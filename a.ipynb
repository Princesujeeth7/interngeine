I replied that I liked maps\\n\\xa0\\n(unordered/ordered) due to their efficiency in search related problems. He then asked\\n\\xa0\\nme basic questions regarding their implementation and hashing. He asked that if I was\\n\\xa0\\nordered to hash the telephone directory how would I go about it. The answer was\\n\\xa0\\nsimple as telephone numbers are already unique keys for the users. He then discussed\\n\\xa0\\nabout my involvement in Xpressions and discussed the plot of ‘Ilhaam’ and how I went\\n\\xa0\\nabout playing a disillusioned man in it. He then asked me to suggest a good algorithm\\n\\xa0\\nfor returning relevant search results in a search engine. I had used the Okapi BM25\\n\\xa0\\nalgorithm in one of my group projects and explained its working. He then asked me if I\\n\\xa0\\nhad any questions and I asked what sort of work Goldman Sachs does and what I could\\n\\xa0\\nexpect if I got selected.\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nInterview 2 -\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nThis was by far the toughest interview I have ever been a part of. It was almost as if the\\n\\xa0\\ninterviewer was looking to get the candidate wrong footed and see if they crack under\\n\\xa0\\npressure. He first asked me why I wanted to join Goldman Sachs and tried giving\\n\\xa0\\ncounter arguments for all the reasons I gave. He asked me about OOPS. I was not very\\n\\xa0\\nconfident about it so I told him the same. He was disappointed as many candidates\\n\\xa0\\ndidn’t know about OOPS. He then I asked me a puzzle.\\n\\xa0\\nhttp://mathhelpforum.com/geometry/43932-dividing-l-shape-into-4-equal-pieces.html\\n\\xa0\\nAgain I knew this puzzle as it had been asked to other candidates and I faked not\\n\\xa0\\nknowing it and arrived at the solution just when he was about to skip the question!

I explained the basic 2-pointers approach.\\n\\xa0\\nHe then gave me an array and asked me to simulate the algorithm.\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nQuestion 2- The second question was tricky. He drew a map of a city with buildings,\\n\\xa0\\nobstacles and roads and defined some endpoints. He asked me that if I ran a cab\\n\\xa0\\nservice how would I go about dropping passengers at the endpoints in the most\\n\\xa0\\nefficient manner. He did not expect me to give the correct answer, he just wanted to\\n\\xa0\\nsee my thinking process and asked me to think out loud.

But then I realized it wouldn’t work and gave\\n\\xa0\\na vague answer using All Points Shortest Path and DP.\\n\\xa0\\nHe then asked me why I wasn’t giving interviews at Microsoft and DeShaw to which I\\n\\xa0\\nreplied because I hadn’t been shortlisted. He further probed into why I hadn’t been\\n\\xa0\\nshortlisted and asked me about the mistakes I made in their coding rounds. Unnerving\\n\\xa0\\nstuff!\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nHe then went on to ask some really tough HR questions based on working in a group\\n\\xa0\\nand leadership, asking what I would do in certain situations (Example : If I was the\\n\\xa0\\nleader of a group and a person informs me that he hadn’t been able to do his work at\\n\\xa0\\nthe eleventh hour, what actions would I take?

He\\n\\xa0\\nstarted on a light note and exorcised the demons of the previous round. He joked if I\\n\\xa0\\nwas related to Rishabh Pant and how fine he played! He then discussed my projects in\\n\\xa0\\ndetail. His interest was particularly piqued by a JavaScript based project and asked me\\n\\xa0\\nabout asynchronous programming and promises. He then asked me about the React\\n\\xa0\\nlife cycle model. I answered all questions to the best of my capacity. He then asked me\\n\\xa0\\nhow I would ensure the security and quality of data delivered to a client. I gave a few\\n\\xa0\\npoints like consulting team mates, knowing what the client wanted via SRS and looking\\n\\xa0\\nat past data. He then gave me an array and asked me how to detect if the array was\\n\\xa0\\nsorted or not (if yes, ascending or descending). He then expected me to optimize and\\n\\xa0\\nimprove the performance of the O(n) approach. I tried a lot, in the end he hinted me\\n\\xa0\\ntowards multi-threading and parallel programming.'),\n",

I coded the question and he asked a couple of\\n\\xa0\\nfollow-up questions. Basically I used indices of the array of strings to build the graph\\n\\xa0\\nbut he wanted to know if we could do this without actually making the graph. Then he\\n\\xa0\\nasked me about its time complexity and then asked me if the answer gave the no. of\\n\\xa0\\nedges or the no. of nodes of the shortest path.\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n2.

Firstly I gave an approach of time complexity O(nklog(k)).\\n\\xa0\\nHe asked me to optimize and tell him all the cases when you need not change the\\n\\xa0\\nencoding while shifting one character(while traversing). Then I told him a solution of\\n\\xa0\\ntime complexity O(nk). Then he asked me to code it, considering all edge cases.

The\\n \\nconcepts used were Two-pointer and hashing as brute force would give TLE. (I wasted a\\n \\nlot of time in this one and couldn’t do it, mainly because the strings given were in char*.)\\n \\n3.\\nSome students wanted circular lunch boxes other wanted rectangular lunch boxes. They\\n \\nall stand in a queue. And lunchboxes were kept on above another in a stack. If a child\\n \\ngets his desired box on top, he takes it. Else he moves back in the queue. Tell number of\\n \\nchildren left who didn’t get the boxes.\\n \\nAs said in the question, I used a queue and a stack for children and boxes respectively. I\\n \\nalso kept a count of remaining children and boxes. If there’s a situation when the box on\\n \\ntop of stack is not taken by any student in the queue, the process stops and the answer\\n \\nis the size of the queue.\\n \\n \\nFirst Interview:\\n \\n \\nHe asked me 2 questions:\\n \\n1.\\nI don’t remember the question exactly but here is the base idea. Given a tree, for each\\n \\nvertex find maximum length path which passes through it. I remember giving normal\\n \\nsolution which didn’t require DP to solve. A normal DFS will work.\\n \\n2.\\nGiven the length of the poem find different rhyming schemes.

There \\nwere two interviewers who constantl\\\\ kept asking questions and kept getting into depth of ever\\\\ \\nquestion the\\\\ were asking. Here¶s what I can recall: \\n \\nƔ The interview started with \\u200bHashing\\u200b. He asked about what hashing is and wh\\\\ it is used. \\nWhile talking about it, I also mentioned that I avoid using hashing in competitive \\nprogramming contests because the\\\\ make test cases to bottleneck the hashing \\nsolutions. Then we had a discussion about wh\\\\ hashing can be a bottleneck. Then he \\nasked be the average as\\\\mptotic time comple[it\\\\ of hash table operations if there are \\u200bn \\nobjects \\u200band\\u200b m buckets. \\u200bI said it was \\u200bO(n/m). \\u200bThen, he argued if we make µm¶ ver\\\\ \\nlarge, n/m would become ]ero. Then I argued back and after a bit of back and forth, I \\narrived at \\u200bO(1+n/m)\\u200b. \\nƔ We had a discussion about wh\\\\ hashing is used in real life even though it can be a \\nbottleneck in CP. Then, he asked me when we would rather use BST structures in real \\nlife. I told him, we would rather have trees if we wanted a sorted order and the\\\\ are also \\nused in database inde[ing (so is hashing but whatever). \\nƔ Then the\\\\ asked me which data structures I was comfortable with. I mentioned quite a \\nfew but I forgot to mention graphs so he asked if I was familiar with graphs. I said \\\\es \\nand then he asked me how to represent courses with prerequisites as a graph. After I \\nanswered him, he asked me how to get the order in which courses should be taken. \\nAfter a bit of thinking, I came up with topological sort. Then we had a discussion about \\ntopological sort. \\nƔ We then had a discussion about the difference between \\u200bpass by reference\\u200b and \\u200bpass \\nby pointer. \\u200bI didn¶t know much about the details about the implementation of pass b\\\\ \\nreference, so I had to creativel\\\\ think of what I would do to implement pass b\\\\ reference. \\nThen, he asked me if there was something I could do with pass b\\\\ reference which I \\ncouldn¶t do with pass b\\\\ pointer. I told him that I didn¶t think so. Then, he asked what \\nabout the other wa\\\\ around to which I talked about memor\\\\ allocation (\\u200bmalloc\\u200b). He still \\nwasn¶t satisfied, so I gave up on this one. \\nƔ There were a few questions about where static, global etc. variables are allocated too. I \\nknew some answers. Didn¶t know others. \\nƔ Then he asked me to t\\\\pe out a simple algorithm in a C++ function. Basicall\\\\, I had to \\nfind the first inde[ in a search string when a particular pattern we are looking for e[ists. I \\nstarted talking about the KMP algorithm but then he asked me to just implement a simple \\nnaive algorithm. I did it and then he asked me which test cases I would run it on. I ran it \\non a couple of test cases. I had initiall\\\\ used pass b\\\\ value. He made me switch to pass'),\n",

After a bit of thinking, I added the \\u200bconst \\u200bke\\\\word to the function \\nsignature. He was satisfied b\\\\ that. \\nƔ He asked me, since I had mentioned inde[ing earlier, what inde[ing is and wh\\\\ it is \\nused.

The ne[t interview was a lot more DBMS/hard drive based probabl\\\\ because \\nof this answer. \\n \\nInterview Round 2\\u200b: (10 candidates were selected for this round. Five of these received a \\nrejection email. Among the remaining five, three had another company higher on their \\npreference order and two were finally on the DE Shaw selections list.) \\u200b1.5 hours \\n \\nThis was one of the most interesting interviews I had faced. It challenged me to think and all that \\ncliche stuff. There were two interviews again. One asked more DBMS related questions, the \\nother asked OOPS a lot more. \\n \\nƔ He started b\\\\ asking me the differences between NoSQL databases and SQL \\ndatabases. I didn¶t know the answer in depth but since I had used both of them, I could \\nclearl\\\\ see a few differences and I told him what I could think of. He was prett\\\\ satisfied. \\nƔ Then, he asked about SQL quer\\\\ e[ecution order. Basicall\\\\, an SQL quer\\\\ has a bunch \\nof terms: \\u200bSELECT, FROM, JOIN, GROUP BY, HAVING, WHERE etc\\u200b. We listed out a \\nfew of these terms and then, he asked me the order in which these operations are \\nperformed. After a bit of thinking and discussion, I arrived at a final order which I don¶t \\nknow is correct or not. He looked satisfied. \\nƔ Then, he kept asking me some Database terms I had never heard of before and some I \\nhad merel\\\\ seen as a heading. For the ones I had never heard of, I simpl\\\\ told him that I \\nhad never heard of them. For the ones I had just seen when scrolling through a \\nte[tbook, I told him that I had seen them somewhere in a te[tbook but didn¶t read about \\nthem. I would sa\\\\ it probabl\\\\ helped doing this instead of just sa\\\\ing I had never heard \\nof them, based on the feedback the\\\\ gave me. \\nƔ There was a pu]]le: \\nż Let a number be represented as ABC where A, B and C are digits. Find such a \\nnumber ABC such that this number is equal to A!+B!+C!. \\nż I had trouble working out this solution silentl\\\\, because having two interviewers \\nwaiting can create a ton of pressure. Then the interviewer asked me to e[plain \\nm\\\\ progress so far, so I started speaking. And I kept on speaking and working \\nm\\\\ wa\\\\ to the solution and landed at the solution within a minute. \\u200bSo, talking \\nhelps!!! \\u200b(Btw, the answer is 145). \\nƔ Then the ne[t interviewer started asking questions. He asked me what I knew about \\nOOPS and wh\\\\ would \\\\ou use OOPS. We had a length\\\\ discussion about it but \\nessentiall\\\\, it was just me talking about all the different properties of OOPS \\n(encapsulation, abstraction etc).'),\n",

I just told him this (didn't had to code this).- He extended this problem where we can make atmost one wall to a road, i.e. transform atmost one 1 -> 0. I told him of a solution where I store the distance of each cell from (1,1) and distance of each cell from (n,m) and then try to make each 1 -> 0 and see if that reduces the distance overall. I guess he had a different solution in mind because he asked me to explain this properly with time and space complexities and also prove it, which I did. After this he asked me to code it in google docs, where my code turned a bit messy because I had lots of just copy pasted parts. So do practice to write clean code beforehand with proper variable names and as many helper functions you want, to avoid any sort of copy paste.\\nGiven an UNSORTED (distinct) array, lets say we are trying to binary search on it for some number. Return a boolean array which corresponds to the numbers which can be binary searched on.An example : [1, 4, 2, 3, 6, 5]then the answer array would be : [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]The questions I asked him was related about his implementation of binary search, like the middle element would be floor((l+r)/2) where l and r are the end indices, array is 0-indexed and r corresponds to the last index (n-1) and not the index after the last index (n, like some implementations of binary search do).The solution was something like I would recursively go into each binary search segment (l,r) and try to see if the middle element in this segment is searchable or not. For this element to be binary searchable, it must be greater than every middle element of the segments in the recursive stack currently where we have gone into the RIGHT half to reach this part, and must be less than every middle element of the segments where we have gone into the LEFT half. This logic can be just reduced to some [mn,mx] limit the numbers in a segment can be to be binary searchable which I pass in the function as extra parameters. I explained this, with the space and time complexities (Both O(n) ) and then coded it.\\nThere were two parts for this question : - First was given an array A of integers, you have to take k integers from the front or the end, ex - if you take en element from the front from [1,2,3,4], then it transforms into [2,3,4], or if decide to take from the end, it transforms into [1,2,3]. Output the maximum sum you can get of the taken numbers.I explained a solution which stores the first k prefix sums and first k suffix sums, but this had a space complexity of O(k), so he asked me if I can reduced it and I reduced this to the O(1) space complexity solution where I take the sum of the first k elements and keep transforming it into the next solution (adding a[n-k+i] and removing a[i]) and output the maximum sum we got here. He asked me to code it and that was it.- Second was given first array A and second array B, we can take k integers , from the front or the end from the first array BUT only from the front from the second array. Output the maximum value we can get where value is the sum of product of the pair of numbers we are taking. Ex. Lets say the numbers we are taking are (A[0], B[0]), (A[n-1], B[1]), (A[1], B[2]), then the value of this particular way of taking the numbers is A[0]*B[0] + A[n-1]*B[1] + A[1]*B[2] .I explained a 2-D dynamic programming approach here ( maybe there is a way we can do this greedily, but I couldn't think up of it). Basically our state dp[i][j] will contain the maximum value we can get when we take i numbers from the second array, and j numbers from the front of the first array ( j-i from the last), explained the recursive steps as well and then I explained a trick which we can use here to not actually use up O(k^2) space but only O(k) space (at any instant, store only the dp[i] vector and dp[i+1] vector). Coded this approach as well and was done.\"),\n",

A list of expenditures is given in following format. [(name, amount), ...]. Eg:- [(\"A\", 20), (\"B\": 40), (\"C\", 55), (\"D\": 55), (\"E\": 80)]. They decided to pay equal amount (50 in this case). After the trip they did some transactions to settle amount. We have find one list of such transactions. In this example it can be [(\"A\", \"E\": 30), (\"B\", \"C\", 5), (\"B\", \"D\", 5)].  (The list need not be minimal in number of transactions)\\nI sorted on amount and used 2 pointer approach. Time Complexity:- O(nlogn). Interviewer asked me if I can optimize it. My second approach was partitioning the array about average (similar to the one used in quick sort) and then use 2 pointer approach. Time Complexity:- O(n)\\nGiven a grid in which in cell represents height of building at that location. From each cell we can move to 4 adjacent cells.

Every time he switches between cities an additional travel cost C which is constant. On first day he can start anywhere (A or B). A_i and B_i are profits earned in selling in city A or B on the ith day. Find the maximum net profit ( total profit - total cost).Follow up - Find any path which gives the maximum net profit.\\nThere is bomb with n 2-state switches. Initial and disarm states are given. Also there is a set of k safe states (each being some combination of switches). You can go from any state to another as long as they differ in only a single switch state. Initial and disarm states are safe. Find if it is possible to disarm the bomb.\\nGiven a person with meeting schedules of form [l,r]. The person also has DND schedules of similar forms when he won\\'t attend a meeting. Meetings can be attended partially. Output the complete schedule of person as disjoint intervals of meet and DND time intervals.\\nSamiksha Sachdeva \\nPeople while chatting tend to type \"helllooooo\" instead of \"hello\" when they are excited. You are given one such word which a person has used. You need to tell where it has extensions. (Return a vector of vectors which includes the starting and ending index of each extension) For this question, an extension is defined as a repetition of 3 or more characters. Example: i/p : \"heeellooo\"o/p: { {1,3}, {6,8} }i/p : \"heyyyyy\"o/p: { {2,6} }\\nThis was a follow up question to the 1st question. You have the function Extension(string s) that you implemented in the 1st question. Apart from that there is a function that you have been given: isWordInDictionary(string s) which returns true if the word s is in the dictionary and false otherwise. We are now given some word, let\\'s say w. We need to find out whether after removing extension from w, the word is in our dictionary or not. For example: heeelllooo -> hello which if it is in our dictionary,  so we return true.What we can do is, we can simply make use of the Extension function to find out the indices of extension and then to finally remove it. Then we can use the given function to check whether it is in our dictionary or not.THE CATCH: The catch here is that \"heeellooo\" could also translate to \"heello\", \"helloo\" and \"heelloo\" as well, as per the definition of extension given to us. So we don\\'t just have to check whether \"hello\" is there in our dictionary or not, we also have to check all the other possibilities to be able to conclude whether it exists in our dictionary or not.\\nThe interviewer was really sweet. He was from Google Mountain View. At the end of the interview, we had a lot of chit chat :p. It was a really nice experience. P.s. Whenever the interviewer asks you if you have any questions, DO NOT say no. Ask some question related to the company. It shows that you are genuinely interested in the company, which is a positive sign.\\nGiven a sorted array of non-overlapping intervals and a new interval, return true if it is possible to insert the new interval into the array without any overlapping. Also, insert it at the correct position. If the insertion results in overlapping, return false.The interviewer said that if such queries keep coming up, which data structure would you use to implement the function. She wanted the time complexity to be better than O(n). What I suggested was that we need to check the condition of overlapping with at most 2 intervals in the given array. We can use binary search to find out the interval that would be immediately before the newInterval if the insertion is possible. We check the condition of overlapping with this particular and its next interval. If any of the two overlap with the newInterval, we return false. Else, we insert the interval between the two and return true.\\nThe question asked was a slight variation of this: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.geeksforgeeks.org/insert-in-sorted-and-non-overlapping-interval-array/amp/\\nJ.

Then he directly went to the problem solving\\npart of the interview.\\nRound started off by a basic sorting question. Given a stream of characters, I was\\nsupposed to sort the numeric characters in decreasing order and alphabetic characters\\nin increasing order and place them at alternate positions in the final array (in case\\nsome positions can\\'t be filled due to absence of alphabets/numbers, you had to leave\\nthose positions empty). I did this question initially using the standard STL C++ sort\\nfunction by using a comparator, but the interviewer asked me to implement my own\\nsorting function. I wrote and implemented a modified merge-sort function and then it\\nwas followed by a brief discussion on the time complexity of the Merge-Sort (I had to\\nmention about Master theorem as well as the argument through recursion tree to convice\\nhim it was O(nlogn) ). He also asked me what is meant by \"in-place\", \"stable\" and\\n\"adaptive\" in context of sorting algorithms. We also had a small discussion over\\nbenefits and demerits of using merge sort. Since I had done my DSA course during third\\nsem sincerely, it was a cakewalk. I would advise to revise the DSA course, especially\\nthe sorting algorithms part. Be comfortable with each sorting algorithm.\\nAnother thing Morgan Stanley focuses a lot on is Object-Oriented System Design. He\\nasked me if I knew OOPs and gave me a simple task of implementing my own book using\\nOOPs concepts. I would recommend reading some standard questions from internet\\nbeforehand like parking lot, hotel reservation system etc. Here, don\\'t assume anything\\non your part. Clarify what entitites Interviewer has in mind and what functionalities\\nhe wants you to code. Here, A book has several pages and every page has paragraphs and\\nevery paragraph has certain words. Some functionalities include counting the\\noccurences of a particular word inside the entire book. Easy question rather, as I had\\nto simply define respective classes (keep mentioning to him, why you kept some\\nattributes as public and why some as private) and I used a hash map for the\\nfunctionality. We had a small discussion on the demerits of hash-map (basically you\\nhave to mention collisions) and techniques by which we can resolve it (separate\\nchaining/ probing).\\nThen he wanted me to add a functionality like Google Search where on a single page, if\\nI write certain initial characters; I should get total count of words on that page\\nthat start with that particular prefix string of characters. I used the data structure\\nTrie to do it. Since I had done a similar question before on Interviewbit, it was a\\ncakewalk. You can read about the implementation of a Trie from GFG. You will have to\\nmodify it a bit though. (Exact question: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-the-\\nnumber-of-words-with-given-prefix-using-trie/ )\\nThen he went on to ask about whether I had DBMS course or not. I mentioned yes but I\\nalso mentioned that I was not really comfortable with it. The biggest take-away here\\nis that it is upon you where you want to take your interview. I hadn\\'t revise DBMS\\nproperly so I mentioned him that I was not comfortable, so he skipped discussing it.\\nIf I would\\'ve said yes, I was sure I was going to be grilled apart. He asked what my\\nfavourite course during my curicullum was, and I told him my favourite Course was DSA'),\n",

If your favourite course is something else\\n(COA/FLAT etc), you can move your interview in that discussion also. He asked me which\\ntopic interests me in DSA most, and I said Graphs. He started off with very simple\\nquestions like what is difference between Graph and tree, what is the various\\nrepresentations of graph (basically Adjancency list and matrix) and how which\\nrepresentation is useful in what scenario. He basically wanted to check my\\nfundamentals rather than giving a straight-forward Graphs question.\\nI know many people whose interviews went bad because they were asked some in-depth\\nquestions about Courses they were not comfortable with. Revise OOPS sincerely, and\\neven courses like DBMS and COA. At last, do ask questions from the interviewer. This\\ngives an impression that you're really interested in joining their company.\\nHR Round (1 hour)\\nMy HR Round went pretty confident and chill. Some questions asked:\\n1. Where do you see yourself in five years? (Give answer in context to what would\\nyou expect out of working in Morgan Stanley. I gave them company-specific\\nanswers like exposure to field of finance as well as SDE etc. DO NOT mention\\nyou want to open your own start-up or want to go for an MBA as that turns them\\noff.\\n2. Any instance in life where I went against what I believed? (I mentioned about\\nmy experience in Club DebSoc)\\n3. If you have a project deadline coming and lot of work is left and your\\nother team member says he cant contribute now due to some unavoidable\\nsituation, what would you do in such a case? (Do not give one specific\\nanswer. Explore all possibilities like extending the deadline by asking\\nthe client, trying to understand what is the condition of friend and\\nasking if he can contribute on weekends and if he still is adamant about\\nhis condition, then continue singlehandedly)\\n4. How was your internship experience of corporate culture at SAMSUNG\\nBangalore? (Basically if you've interned previously at any corporate\\nsetup or even worked under Coding Club/ SWC, they will want to know what\\nyou learnt apart from basic technical skills. Mention team work,\\ndocumentation, desigining your project before working and professional\\ninteraction with colleagues)\\n5. Some overview about my Projects. My 2nd year internship project was\\nrelated to Computer Networking, so I mentioned it as a plus point for\\nmyself that I'm someone who can grasp and learn new things easily(I had\\nno formal introduction to Computer Networking before doing my project at\\nSamsung). Try to use any discussion into your advantage. Rule of thumb\\nis: What is some skill you learnt in any of your past experience? Then:\\nHow that skill makes you special? Then: Relate it to why would it suit\\nMorgan Stanley's culture.\\nAt last, ask questions about Company to HR. For around 20 minutes, I asked around 3-4\\nquestions to the HR about Morgan Stanley's work culture, their training programme,\\nperks, daily life schedule and any questions you have (I had one prime question about\\nsince MS is one of world's prime Investment Banking firm, how would I get exposure to\\nFinance if I wanted to since I would be given a Technology Analyst role) .

First question(most important) was to introduce\\nyourself and based on my answer he asked me about my project. He didn't went into\\ntechnical details but asked me about my experience of doing projects, what problems i\\nfaced while working in a team and how did we solved it. We had discussion on my\\nprojects for about 30 mins. Then he asked me questions liked What are your long term\\ngoals in life?, Major Strengths and how would they help you in your professional\\nlife?, Describe a task/situation that you faced, which you consider as a complex\\nproblem. How did you approach the problem?, What is your backup plan if you fail to\\nget a job in software industry?, What do you consider to be your most significant\\nprofessional/academic achievement.

If one\\nset is finished before the other, then also skip 1 place for filling the rest of the\\nelements. I explained to him 2 approaches - a counting sort type of approach and\\nanother on multiset. He asked for the code of counting sort approach and walk him\\nthrough it. I completed the code fulfilling the requirements. But he was not convinced\\neven though it was an O(n) solution, and modularized code. He wanted an in-place\\nalgorithm to solve it, even if it means sacrificing for the time complexity.

Didn't went very good though. The second interview was more about the CV. Straight \\naway started with the projects. I was well prepared for that. So I went really deep and he seemed impressed. The project discussion went for some \\ntime and then asked an oops question regarding function overriding (first what is that and how compiler distinguishes it). Didn't know the second \\nanswer and I told him straightway. Next he asked a puzzle( standard gfg- ages of three girls). He was more interested in knowing my thought process \\nand how I approach. We were running out of time so he skipped before I could reach the answer. Next he asked me to code for binary search(really \\nreally basic) and this took me only a few minutes.

He also asked me about competitive programming as I \\nhad mentioned it in my resume.\\nThen he directly started asking technical and shared an online editor link to write code.\\nTechnical questions were:\\n1)The first was an easy question related to array and strings. He asked me to write the code on the editor and dry run on 2-3 test cases given by him. \\n2)Given inorder traversal find the preorder traversal. (He gave the tree structure when I told him there are many answers possible). (He gave me an \\nexample I had to only write the answer for that example )\\n3)A small discussion on methods of hashing a string so that the number of collisions is reduced. (https://cp-algorithms.com/string/string-\\nhashing.html)\\nThen he asked me two puzzles. (I wasn’t able to solve the second one fully but discussing with him and asking for hints helped.)\\n1)https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-set-35-2-eggs-and-100-floors/\\n2)https://testfunda.com/examprep/learningresources/pod/puzzle-12--crossing-the-desert.htm?assetid=be419348-1537-4f67-8ad9-0fdda19d3902\\nThen he asked about my favorite Academic subject among the courses listed in my resume and I told him number theory( as I was not sure about my \\nDBMS knowledge) and then he asked its applications. I told him about cryptography and Bitcoins. Then he asked a question which involved the \\ngeneration of random numbers modulo prime and I answered it. \\nThen he asked me whether I have any questions for him. I asked him about the role offered and my work if I get selected.\\nHR interview:  ( went for about 30-45 min)\\nIn this round, he went through my resume thoroughly asking briefly about the projects that I had mentioned. Then he started discussing DBMS and \\ntransactions. He asked me about the ACID property of databases and gave a follow-up question ( it was a question involving something like  whether \\nan insertion will happen on a database if there were some primary key violations. He asked me to use the ACID property to answer this question. )\\nThen he asked some typical HR questions like why oracle? Biggest achievements and failures? Difficulties you faced while working on a project? How \\ndo you approach a new project when you have no idea about it?. Overall it was a fun round as the interviewer was friendly and helpful.\"),\n",

My ﬁrst\\nquestion was \"consider you have a very huge Music library like youtube and all those music is stored in\\nsome data centers, you can\\'t store it in the list of music(array) and you know the no of music in prior. You\\nhave to write a shuﬄe function that plays all the songs randomly and also none of the music should be\\nrepeated.\\nOn completion of all n music, you have to restart this same function.\" The answer was pretty obvious and\\nquite easy. After discussing the edge cases I explain the solution within 2-3 minutes (choosing the random\\nindex and play that song and after completion swap that song with the last song and decrease n by one)\\nand the interviewer was quite satisﬁed by that and asked me to write the working code and I wrote the\\nrecursive solution and he said good \\n .\\nNow he asked me to design an algorithm for the Pokemon game. You have a large area and live coordinates\\nare given for Pokemon and the people around the Pokemon (everyone is moving).Pokemon wants to visit\\nall the person which is within the circle of ﬁxed radius from him.

They started with the stack question in which\\nyou have push, pop, and ﬁnd_max operation. They said that you don\\'t have to write brute force, quickly\\njump to the best possible answer you can give. I gave O(1) time and O(1) space solutions for all those\\noperations. Link to the question\\nThe hard part of the interview was that they were not giving much time on any question, They said that you\\nhave to solve it as fast as possible within 5 minutes.\\nThe next question was to write the c++ script for extracting all the ﬁles within a folder and its subfolder.\\nThe answer was quite obvious with the help of recursion. After that, they asked around 5 to 6 more\\nquestions, I don\\'t remember all of those but every question was easy and medium level. They also asked to\\nexplain how will you design a snake game ( they wanted the data structures you will use and the algorithms\\noverview ). They asked one string problem \"You have a large string of size 10^6, every character is a small\\nEnglish alphabet (a-z). You have to ﬁnd the lexicographically smallest substring which contains all those\\ncharacters exactly ones. E.g. string = \"cbabcc\" here two substrings are possible \"cba\" , \"abc\". so the\\nlexicographically smallest would be \"abc\".\\nI quickly come up with O(n) solution (compare every window of size k, k is the size of the ﬁnal answer) for\\nthis and the interviewer was satisﬁed with my solution. After 7 to 8 technical questions, they jumped on the\\nquestion related to App Development. They asked questions related to resume what I used and why I\\nprefer that, Explain how you will do this even though I had never done that before the wanted to know my\\nstrategy and was quite happy with my answers. In the end, he said you will get a call from H.R. I was happy\\nafter that.\\nHR/Manager Round\\nH.R. rounds are nearly the same for every company. But the answer may diﬀer for diﬀerent companies.

You only have to\\nread the pdf ﬁle which is attached with the mail that describes the job role.\\n2. Must prepare for the answer that how you are ﬁt for the company. You only have to match your\\nvalues with the company. for e.g. a company has values \"Don\\'t complain, ﬁx it\", you have to answer\\nwhich describes that you always try to ﬁx the problem you face in any project or anywhere.\\n3.

The ﬁrst question was given an array of integers give the next smaller element to the right for each\\nand every element. I was asked write the code for the solution in a google doc. I told an approach in\\nwhich we traversed the array in once in reverse direction using a stack. The interviewer told me to\\ncode a solution which traverses the array once in forward direction, also implemented it using stack.\\n2. In the second question I was given a binary tree and I had to print the tree as seen from the bottom.\\nquestion. Was also asked to code this one.\\n3. The last one was a puzzle,.\\nInterview 2\\nThe second Interview was largely focused on project knowledge and also 2 coding questions were asked.\\nFirst I was asked about a frontend project that I had done in react JS. Made me run the project and\\ndemonstrate it by sharing my screen and also we discussed speciﬁc parts of code from github, what were\\ntheir roles and he also tested my knowledge of reactJS and CSS.\\n1. First coding question was, Link to question, ﬁrst I told the brute force solution and then told the\\nspaced optimized one and also coded it on a google doc.\\n2. The second question was, given a tree with each node having a particular value, and we had to print\\nthe path, the sum of nodes on which is equal to a given value S. I told a bfs solution ﬁrst to print\\nwhether such path existed or not and then added the code to print the path.\\nHR/Manager Round\\nI was asked why I wanted to join sprinklr and what are the things I look for in a company I want to work in.\\nAlso, I was given a work related problem and was asked how I would deal with it.'),\n",

He asks several basic questions like how it is different from SQL, why use mongo dB for your project and how it is better than relational type of databases.\\n\\n> My third project was a YouTube extension. He simply asked me about what where the tech stacks used.\\n\\nTips :-\\n\\n> Always be ready with a short and clear explanation of your all projects and just memorize it and clearly explain him with confidence (Do not make it too long ,it is just 3 - 5 mins including projects intro).\\n\\n> Always remember to justify why you use a particular tech stack for your project , know it’s brief introduction and how it is better than other alternate tech stacks (like in my case I need to know about what is mongo dB and why I use it and why it is better than MySQL).\\n\\nAdobe interveiw questions and experinces 2024\\n\\nUdit Jethva (Research)\\n\\nRound 1 : Online Assessment\\n\\nConsisted of problems from basic statistics and probability fundamentals. MA225 should be enough for the kind of questions asked. There was no question based on ML fundamentals as far as I remember. 2-3 Logical Reasoning problems were also asked. There were 2 DSA questions at the end, easy ones. People who scored well were shortlisted irrespective of CGPA, Branch. (My guess)\\n\\nRound 2 : Technical Interview\\n\\nEveryone had a 30 min long online interview with the time slots fixed. My interviewer was a PhD researcher working at the Bengaluru office. We began with an introduction. [Your introduction is crucial as it can literally give direction to how your interview goes. Of course companies will ask what they have to ask, but this may sway some questions to the topics in which you are comfortable. Mention your strong topics, courses, relevant hobbies (like Competitive Programming, Kaggle, CTFs).] He then asked me to explain a project which I was most confident about. I picked my 4th project which was a Wordle solving bot [Whenever an interviewer asks you to pick up a project, pick the one on which you can talk the most. This will consume interview time and project discussion is something in which you have the reins of the \\n\\n\\n\\ninterview and can be used to make a solid impression. In my case, the project also involved some mathematics which made it much more relevant.] I tried explaining to him the project which took a while because we didn’t have the luxury of a pen and paper. The project involved greedily optimising the next move in the game which required something similar to probability distributions (You can check it out on my github profile : u-d-ash). This math interested him and we also had lengthy discussions on the methods which I was using and alternatives which could’ve been used to improve results. He looked very happy with the work I had put in and expressed a desire to work with me. \\n\\nNote : My project was pretty elaborate which took most of my interview time but my peers were asked probability, ML fundamentals, math puzzles as well.\\n\\nAnd yes, I got in.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\DELL\\\\OneDrive\\\\Desktop\\\\genai1\\\\data\\\\Internship Interview Experiences\\\\Alphagrep.docx'}, page_content=\"Alphagrep interveiw questions and experiences 2022\\n\\nSiddharth Khincha\\n\\nCoding Round\\n\\nThere was a CPI cutoff of 8.0 to be able to attempt the coding round. There were five questions, mostly of medium difficulty. I later found out that a few even had GeekForGeeks pages, so they were standard problems. Alphagrep is an HFT, so they are biased by CPI, and it was probably considered along with the coding round results to create the final interview shortlist. I managed to solve 3 + partial problems out of the 5. They had a stricter criterion for the SDE role than the Quant role.\\n\\nInterview Round-1\\n\\nThis was mostly a puzzle-based round. The puzzles were mostly standard and should be doable with some practice. Once we got through the introductory formalities, we dived right into the questions.\\n\\nThe first question was, if I drop a stick and it breaks at two places, what is the probability that the three pieces form a triangle? I first listed the simple observations, such as the Triangle Inequality Theorem, and then proceeded to use an intuitive way to find the answer. He then said, why don't you mathematically prove the same? The core principles remained the same; I integrated and solved the question to get the same answer. He was satisfied.\\n\\nThe next question was https://www.cut-the-knot.org/blue/Chameleons.shtml. I was able to solve that as well.\\n\\nWe were done with the central portion of the interview. I then asked him a bunch of questions about what he does at Alphagrep and what my role, if selected, would be.\\n\\nInterview Round-2\\n\\nThis round had an emphasis on coding. We started with introductions, and then he asked me a few questions about my resume. I had quite a bit of ML on it, so he asked me why I wanted to work in quant, not ML, etc. So, be prepared for such questions. Then a couple of more minutes of discussion on my experience.\\n\\nThen he started with the questions. He asked about the intricacies of Quicksort, such as different time complexities in different cases and how we can get O(Nlog(N)). Always be careful not to guess unless you explicitly mention it, as they will jump on any opportunity to catch you in a fallacy. He was a 2020 pass-out from our college and was a candidate master on Codeforces. He asked for my handle. I hadn't competitively programmed much, had a lowish rating and \\n\\n\\n\\nexplained the same to him. He replied by asking me if I did not like to code. I clarified my stance on liking Machine Learning more, finding competitive programming boring, and explaining that I was coding either way.\\n\\nWe then moved on to a coding question which took up most of the interview. The question was, you have n bulbs, numbered from 1 to n, all initially turned off. You then have a certain number of queries. In each query, you have a number p of a bulb to turn on. If the bulb had already been turned on, it stays the same. In return to the query, you return the largest number i, such that all bulbs up to and including ‘i’ are turned on. I started with the most basic approach to get myself time to think. Storing the bulbs in an array and just iterating for every query.\\n\\nI thought of using a segment tree since I saw range queries. He asked me if I had ever coded a segment tree before. I said no. He said we don't want to go there then. Then I thought of an approach using LinkedList and unordered maps. We store the bulbs as a LinkedList, which is hashed. Then every time we need to remove a bulb, we just access the hashmap to see if it is present in the list; if it is, we remove it. The return value would always be *(head of the list) -1. I implemented the approach and did some error management. He was happy with this approach. Then another approach struck me: just keep a variable to store the largest number i, such that all bulbs up to and including i are turned on. On receiving a new query, the variable only moves forward, and after a huge number of queries, we get an amortized O(1) complexity. This was the actual approach he was looking for. We ended with questions for him. He spoke about college, his hostel, etc. We even spoke about my being in CSEA and other things I'm involved in on campus. Not sure how much this impacted the result.\\n\\nGeneral Comments\\n\\nThe smallest things can have big impacts. Practice speaking with confidence and know your projects in and out. You can control the flow of the interview in the intro, so choose what you say wisely and play to your strengths. Do not guess answers or lie on your resume, as they can easily catch most lies. Good Luck!\\n\\nDhruv Somani\\n\\nInterview 1\\n\\nMy interviewer was a graduate of IIT Guwahati, and an ICPC regionalist, so he was well-familiar with competitive programming. After the round of introductions, I was directly asked to solve https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/lru-cache/. I suggested an initial data structure which would perform both updates and retrievals in O(log n). He then asked me to improve upon this, and I demonstrated an algorithm to perform one in O(1) and the other in O(log n). He still wanted an improvement on this and was looking for a method to perform both in O(1). He also quizzed me on the best case, average case and worst case time complexities of the standard sorting algorithms. I was also asked the time complexities of some standard C++ STL functions and the proper reasoning behind them.\\n\\nI couldn’t think of one in the required time, and we moved on to the next question.\\n\\nIt was an easy brain teaser, which required a ‘greedy’ technique.\\n\\nFinally, I asked him a few questions about his role at Alphagrep.\\n\\nVatsal Gupta:\\n\\nRound 1\\n\\n>Putnam question extending 3 points on the circle to 4 points on a sphere (The hardest problem on the hardest test)\\n\\n>some questions from 50 cp like infinite random walk and dropping a stick, break into two pieces expected length of the shorter side\\n\\n>some questions on ML since I had mentioned it in my projects.\\n\\nRound 2\\n\\n>3 chameleon problem Chameleons of Three Colors\\n\\n>Traingle making with a dropping stick, integrational, intuitive(mine own explanation by seeing recursive nature of the problem), and graph(classical) approaches.\\n\\n>splitting cards to have equal up and down faces in a dark room.\\n\\n>Egg drop riddle Can you solve the egg drop riddle? - Yossi Elran\\n\\n>Probability with state diagrams and changing states question\\n\\nAlphagrep interveiw questions and experiences 2024\\n\\nAAGAM BHAVESH MEHTA\\n\\nOnline Interview\\n\\nSDE Role\\n\\nPrerequisite : CPI 9+ hai toh he chance hai aisi company me.

Bohat chances hai ki wo aapko hints bhi dega bas sahi se sunte rehna aur make sure that you both are on the same boat.\\n\\nMy both of the interviewers were very chill and made sure that I understood the question well and also explained me using some examples.\\n\\nBasically ye pura ka pura jo order-book ke related implementation pe question tha wo online quora pe mil jaayega kisi na kisi ke interview experience me.\\n\\nI was then not called for the round 2 of the interview and the reason that I think is low CPI :(\\n\\nTIPS:\\n\\nThey want people with at least 9 CPI.\\n\\nSo CPI acchi rakhna if you are targeting companies like Alphagrep.\\n\\nCP should be strong. \\n\\nThey also grill you on some core cs concepts and OOPS.

The interview consisted of only 1 round i.e. Technical Round (1 hr)\\n\\nRound 1 :\\n\\nThe interview starts with the interviewer's introduction. He then asked me to introduce myself (which consisted of basic intro + project briefing). I didn’t waste much time elaborating about my projects ( because the interviewer doesn’t have your CV in hand at the time of interview ), so as to give him some idea about what I have done during the semester. He just questioned me about the projects based on what I have said: \\n\\nWhich project did you find the most interesting one?\\n\\nDid you do any group projects?\\n\\nHe then proceeded to ask me DSA questions (Live Coding). Since Amazon follows Think-out Loud Procedure (Just explain to the interviewer what you are writing in the code and what you are thinking while building the logic). I was asked to follow the same while solving questions given by him.\\n\\nThe first question, he asked me to solve was the House Thief Problem \\n\\nhttps://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/description/\\n\\nSo, this is a standard 1D-DP problem. I started solving it by recursion then optimising it by Memoization (DP). He then asked me the Time and Space Complexity of the code I had written. He then asked me to do a dry run on a given test case whether my solution actually works or not, which I did. He then asked whether I can optimise it further, which I did by applying Space Optimization which kinda convinced him :)\\n\\nThe second question, he asked me to solve was the Course Schedule Problem\\n\\nhttps://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/description/\\n\\nSo, again this is a standard Graph problem involving Topological Sort. I started explaining to him the key logic of this problem. Then I started to code with a simultaneous explanation. After completing the code, he asked me what is the time and space complexity.\\n\\nAtlast, I just asked him some basic questions on his job experiences, workload etc.\\n\\nThe interview ends here.\\n\\nTips for cracking this interview:\\n\\nDon’t waste much time explaining your projects to the interviewer as he/she doesn’t have your CV. Moreover, they are more interested in testing your\\n\\n\\n\\ntechnical skills rather than projects. Even if you want to say something about your projects, spending 3 to 4 minutes as a whole is completely fine.\\n\\nStriver’s A2Z sheet problems must be in fingertips.\\n\\nAlways explain what you are thinking and what you are writing !!!!\\n\\nMukka Koushik\\n\\nMy interview started at 10:00 am.It was the first among all people selected for amazon.There were two interviewers,each asked one question.First question was just inorder traversal.They asked me to code it in any language and explain the dry run,which I did in 10 minutes.Then the second question was kind of like a questions observed in codeforces.I don’t remember it exactly but its similar to Meeting roomsInterviewBithttps://www.interviewbit.com › problems › meeting-ro... , with extra requirements asked.I am not sure if I answered the question completely,but I told many ideas,which interviewers said were correct.No other questions were asked,as each interview only lasts 1 hour.No other rounds were conducted.Decision was based on only one interview.\"),\n",

While not too difficult, paying heed to their persistent calls to complete a demo assessment before heading for the actual test definitely helped. The platform was pretty interactive, so giving the test directly without previous exposure to the type of questions is bound to leave one a bit dazed.\\n\\nØ This round also had a personality assessment test which was to be attempted after submitting the logical assessment. Don’t really know if it had any weightage in regard to the entire selection process (if at all).\\n\\nAfter the initial assessment, shortlisted candidates proceeded to the coding round. There were 2 questions all in all (Time-1 hr). The questions were of easy-to-medium difficulty level. Since we were expected to complete this anytime over a span of a few days, the questions were different for everyone. Common topics- tree traversals, string matching, etc (STL is a must).\\n\\nINTERVIEW:\\n\\nThe entire interview process consisted of 2 rounds, a technical round, and a technical + HR round.\\n\\nTechnical round:\\n\\nThe interviewer began with a few HR-type questions, followed by questions on DBMS. The questions were mostly theoretical.\\n\\nIn-depth knowledge of DBMS is expected (Normal forms, keys, ACID properties, functional dependencies, etc.). Some challenging SQL query-based questions were also asked.\\n\\nEx- Find the nth highest salary in an employee-salary table (only attributes present are names and salaries) without using functions like rank(), dense_rank() and ORDER BY etc.\\n\\nnested queries is one possible approach\\n\\nNOTE: The interview experience was different for everyone. Some candidates were asked questions from OOPs too. So overall one is expected to know concepts from OOPs, DBMS and DSA.\\n\\nTechnical-HR round:\\n\\nTypical HR questions were asked. A common recurring theme was interviewees being asked their favourite programming language. ANY answer of a language higher-level than C++ (or C++ itself) is ideal, otherwise, the interviewer may accuse one of being obsolete.\\n\\nDivyesh Vankar\\n\\nPre Interview:\\n\\nThis time Barclays comes in end of 2nd year that is in April. Firstly we have online assessment that contain 2 coding round question (both medium level 1 from array and string 1 from graphs) and one round of aptitude test and one round of behavioral round whole assessment of 3hrs. Aptitude test has logical question its not like general they give us one paragraph with story type and than ask question from that. Behavioral questions are normal as ask in other companies. Its okay if you are not able to attend all aptitude questions. Accuracy matters more.\\n\\nAfter this we have to submit our CV who got selected in this online assessment. Who got selected in CV round are got opportunity to attend the Barclay Discovery Program in which they explain us about how their company works and all other things about Barclays. This is online one day program and one day schedule for interview.\\n\\nInterview Experience:\\n\\nInterview has two rounds first on is technical and next one HR round.\\n\\nTechnical interview: In this round basic questions were asked and than 2 to 3 DSA questions in which 1 is basic definitions of some data structures and one is from Tree Data structure Bottom View of Tree. 2 questions from DBMS (as OS is not been taught at that time they skip it) both are easier to medium level. After this he move to resume discussion about project and experience If you have any. And than move to behavioral questions like : Have you ever collected data? Have you ever take stand for group of people? If you are not able to complete your work on time what would you do ? such questions were asked.\\n\\nHR Interview: This is mainly focused on my self like from where I started my jouney? What is your long term goal? Where you can see in next 3 to 5 years? What would you do for society if you are rich enough? In this round interviewer in my case very friendly.\\n\\nTips : If you have enough greep medium level on DSA Barclay is easy to crack. Just the thing is you have to focus on behaviour questions and you have to be good story teller. CGPA is not more focused point in Barclays mine is less than 7.5 !\\n\\nRidhiman Dhindsa\\n\\nEligibility: CSE, MNC, DSAI, ECE    Final offers: 9\\n\\nThe selection process consisted of an aptitude test, personality questionnaire, and coding test. Those who completed these steps were selected to attend the Barclays Discovery Programme for 2 days. After that, they had 2 interviews- technical and HR. People selected after this were offered PIOs. There were tight deadlines for completing the application and tests. \\n\\nAptitude Test: It had mental ability, patterns, graph/data analytics questions, statistics(median, mode, standard deviation), etc. Level like NTSE/JEE mains. \\n\\nPersonality Questionnaire:  assessed your work style. Read up on Barclays’ 5 pillars and desired leadership qualities for this. (It’s all on the website.) Knowing the history of Barclays (330 years of it :) ) is important if you want to make an impression during the program. Helps in interviews too.\\n\\nCoding Test (1 hr, 2 questions):\\n\\nOne was on modular exponentiation (O(log y) time). Another was related to finding the minimum sum of any 2 elements (positive/negative) from 2 arrays, given some weights (Vapour density type of question). Could do both. Around 20 from IITG were selected to attend the program. \\n\\nTechnical Interview (45 minutes): \\n\\nThe interviewer had been working with the company for 15 years. He asked my introduction (Typical “Tell me about yourself.”), then asked which subjects was I interested in. I responded to DSA and DBMS. He questioned me a lot on DBMS, both RDBMS/DBMS (NoSQL). He asked about ACID properties, and the difference between RDBMS, and DBMS. Asked for examples of each of these and where are they used. He asked a few basics about some data structures and time complexities. Then he went on to projects. My major project was in app dev Flutter and Dart. So I explained it in detail - all features, implementation, and any obstacles along the way. Also whenever you specify any weakness/obstacle in the project, always tell what solution you came up with to mitigate that. He asked me to describe all the APIs used in the project and counter-questioned on the payment gateway and QR code generation. After he was satisfied with the why and how of everything, he asked if I had any questions for him. I asked what was something that he really liked about working at Barclays. He answered with his insights and then we concluded. Tip- They judge how you react in pressurized situations, so keep a calm and respectful disposition. For instance, in my interview(online) I got disconnected in between for 5 min due to net issues. So I apologized for the problem when I rejoined. The interviewer was understanding and even cracked a light-hearted joke :) \\n\\nHR Interview (30-40 minutes):\\n\\n\\n\\nThis time also it was someone who’d been working with Barclays for 10 years. Initially, he looked at my resume and asked about my JEE adv+mains ranks. I think he was verifying whether the CV and person match. He commented on my previous achievements and seemed impressed. He asked for my introduction. Through that, he questioned my role as Technical manager in CSEA. He asked for instances of leadership qualities and teamwork. Then he asked how would differences be settled between team members. Asked for an experience when you overcame an obstacle in life, and what you learned from them. He also asked for an example where I might have gone out of the way to help someone. Then he asked about my projects. He too was very interested in the APIs and how I had used them. He asked, why didn’t you implement the payment API yourself? I answered that actual transactions are required to be secure and fail-proof, and I was not an expert in cybersecurity like that. He seemed satisfied. Then he asked if I had any questions for him. I asked the same thing, what was his favorite thing about working at Barclays? He described his work in detail and even gave me a good review of how I’d performed in the interview.'),\n",

The interviewer had a finance background which worked in my favour as finance was my strong side as well. He went into each and every detail related to the project and how we built our approach along with an explanation of some financial concepts I had mentioned which were used in the projects. Next, he moved on to my second project which was around basic Deep learning. He asked me about the CNN CRNN models which I had used along with the steps taken in the project to pre-process the data before feeding it into the models.\\n\\nHe was quite impressed as I was able to answer both projects with clarity and though they were group projects he was satisfied that I was able to answer questions on parts that my teammates did.\\n\\nAfter this He discussed a few of my achievements and asked me about IOQP and NTSE (Weird no one has asked about this) and if I had an interest in physics to which i agreed that physics was my fav before college.\\n\\nFinally, he asked me where exactly my interest lies in if I have to think after graduation - quant, ml, or development to which I replied that I definitely have more expertise in finance (he asked about POR) and ML but I had started taking interest in development as well becoz of which BNY would be a good fit for me being an investment bank :)\\n\\nRound 2 (IN PERSON)- this was the most uncomfortable interview i have ever given because I expected this to be a DSA / Oops concepts round as everyone faced one dsa and one CV/HR round.\\n\\nRather it was more like an Aptitude / HR kind of round.\\n\\nThe interviewer wanted to test my logical thinking and asked some simple reasoning questions which I cracked easily then he started asking some questions that were not clear in terms of what he was expecting from me.\\n\\nI just tried to share whatever I could understand and think of based on the very little info he gave and had no clue if I was moving in the right direction.\\n\\nLater he asked me a few questions like What does BNY do and what are your expectations from BNY etc. and the round ended.\\n\\nTIPS\\n\\nDSA was asked to almost every other candidate but as i was able to grab focus on Finance they were more interested to test me on this part.\\n\\nDo read about BNY and what it does as they have multiple operations rather than just an investment bank.\\n\\nTry to interact as much as possible even if you are stuck to constantly seek hints.\\n\\nDiya Agarwal\\n\\nInterview - 2 rounds (Both virtual)\\n\\nRound 1 (Technical)\\n\\nStarted with a simple puzzle (25 horses and you need to find the fastest 3 only 5 can race at a time so how many races required, further asked if we want to know the 4th fastest horse)\\n\\nThen gave a simple array question\\n\\nIn which you need to remove all the zeroes and add it to the back\\n\\nEg. ar = [0,2,5,1,0,6]\\n\\nOutput should be [2,5,1,6,0,0] \\n\\nDo it in O(1) space\\n\\nThen next question \\n\\nAgain one array is given and you have to find triplets such that the sum is equal to a given number B\\n\\nYou can’t use a no. More than once\\n\\nThen general DSA knowledge questions such as diff bw a heap and a stack \\n\\nWhich heap is priority queue by default and Write the syntax if you want to change it\\n\\nThere were some more questions regarding linked list and other dsa topics like theoretical ones \\n\\nHe just wanted to check if you have deep knowledge of DSA\\n\\nThen at last he asked me to open MS paint and drew me a graph with nodes and edges and asked me to explain how will I find the shortest path from one node to another \\n\\nBasically wanted me to explain dijkstra algorithm visually and asked me what are the drawbacks of dijkstra and what else can you use\\n\\nRound 2 (Technical + HR)\\n\\nThis was also pretty chill because the interviewer was not expecting to take an interview that day. Due to less time he was given my interview at the last moment\\n\\nSo again he asked me to first introduce myself then gave me 2 simple coding questions\\n\\nReverse a no. Using maths and not strings \\n\\n2nd one was to implement bubble sort and then Optimise it\\n\\nThen he asked me about a project of mine which I explained\\n\\nI explained how the model works (it was an ML based project) \\n\\nThen we discussed my PORs and asked me what situations I usually handle and if I have been stuck in any of them\\n\\nThen he gave me a situation and wanted 3 solutions from me\\n\\n\\n\\nSuppose you are an ATM engineer and you need to tackle the problem of ATM machine running out of cash and the customers are dissatisfied \\n\\nThen we had a normal conversation for 5-10 mins regarding my college experiences.\\n\\nTIPS - if you are stuck at some point or if you feel that you are not able to recall something then you can ask for hints. Generally the questions are not tough and with the help of a small hint you will be able to proceed smoothly.\\n\\nAlso it is very important to speak up your thought process, the interviewer should know what you are thinking.'),\n",

Cutoff was around 3.5 questions   + heavy CPI bias  for shortlisting . \\n\\nRound 1 : \\n\\n\\tStraight away started off with the DSA / CP question . \\n\\nQ : You are given n jobs with starting time and ending time and all the jobs are non overlapping . You have a CPU which can work for k minutes . You can start the CPU at any time (even between a job)  , you get a coin for each minute of work . Tell the maximum coins you can get .\\n\\nAns : Based on suffix sum   + binary search  . Let's say you start the CPU at job i (it is always beneficial to start at the start of the job (Try to prove !!)) calculate the total coins you will collect by doing binary search on the start times  (take care of the edge cases where you would stop at the middle of a job) . \\n\\nFurther he changed the question to let's say you have m CPU ‘s  (constraint for n was reduced from 1e5 to 1e3 m m <= 1e3 as well . ) . Now I changed the approach to 2D DP where dp[i][j] represents the max coins collected starting at job i with j cpu ‘ s left . \\n\\n\\n\\n\\tHe was satisfied with the approach and told me to code in coderpad  as well  . \\n\\nRound 2\\n\\n\\t\\tAnother pure DSA round . This time the question was quite challenging . I was asked to devise a data structure that could have upto 1e9 elements but the insert  , update  ,  delete\\n\\nand printing an element functions should have subnormal time complexities   . \\n\\n\\tI was really confused on what to do  , he give me some hints regarding link lists . I finally came up with something about dividing the elements to blocks of size k and maintaining a hash map for all k blocks , and having the constraint that whenever size goes above 2k i will split into 2 blocks  . I had a really hard time coding it and could not finish it completely . \\n\\nHe was kinda convinced but for the majority of the interview i was struggling only  , still managed to get called for the next round  . \\n\\nActual solution is close; you had to maintain linked lists and manage the updates based on the size of the linked list and split it accordingly . In this way for 1e9 elements the time complexity would be around root(n) for each operation . \\n\\nRound 3 : \\n\\nStandard HR round asked a bit about projects , teamwork and why do you want to join Databricks ?  , kind of questions . \\n\\nRound 4 \\n\\n\\n\\n For some reason I had a 4th round as well which was again a DSA round , the question was again similar to the 2nd round , about devising a data structure  . It was mainly doable with unordered maps and queue data structure  . This time i was able to solve and code the question as well and the interviewer was satisfied . \\n\\nTips  :\\n\\nHeavy focus on DSA kind of questions , the 2nd question had concepts related to theory of amortized analysis  . So just keep DSA on your tips .\\n\\nAmple time is given and they help with hints as well  , so just try to make use of that and stay relaxed.\\n\\nCoding Round : 4 questions to be solved in 70 mins. 1 easy, rest med- hard. (Everyone had different questions) People who solved 3+ were shortlisted. \\n\\nDhanesh V\\n\\nRound 1 (Technical): \\n\\nAfter a quick introduction, the interviewer directly jumped to the question. I was asked to code in coderpad. Let T(n) be a fibonacci tree of order n then T(n) is constructed recursively by making T(n-2) as left child and T(n-1) as right child. We name the nodes of the fibonacci tree by doing a preorder traversal. Given two nodes, start and end. Find the path string corresponding to the shortest path between these two nodes. I initially suggested the brute force approach and the interviewer had a brief discussion with its time complexity and since it was exponential, he told me to optimize. He gave a hint : How will u do this problem if you have the path strings from root to every other node in the tree. This hint helped me to suggest the optimal solution and I started coding. The power went off in the middle and I could rejoin the meet only after 5 mins or so and the interviewer told he was happy with my approach and code so far was good and then told me to join the next round.\\n\\nRound 2 (Technical): \\n\\nThis round was more chill than Round 1. My interviewer worked in Facebook (Now META) for 18 years and joined Databricks recently. Again after a brief intro, he gave me the question. Consider the alphabets are mapped with integers from 1 to 26 A-> 1; B->2; C->3; … Z->26; Given a string containing only numbers, return the valid number of alphabet strings that you could construct from this. eg : for “11” ans is 2 (aa, k) I told him the recursive approach and explained how we can memoise using dp and then I coded it. He ran it and told me to handle the cases where 0 also can be present and I handled it. He was happy with the approaches and \\n\\n\\n\\nmy coding style and asked me if I had any questions for him. After a brief chit chat my round 2 ended. \\n\\nRound 3(Behavioral): \\n\\nMy interviewer for this round was the director of Databricks Bangalore office. He was mainly interested in my projects on this ground and covered both technical and behavioral aspects of it. He then asked some general HR questions and asked if I had any questions for him. After that he gave me a positive review and I was sure I got selected.\"),\n",

I had not, and lied that I had. They were able to catch my lie. Then they asked me how much in assets DE Shaw manages. I said 500 billion USD (massive blunder). The interviewers started laughing.\\n\\nThen one interviewer said: The rest of the interview is going to be based on what was discussed in the PPT talk.\\n\\nThere was a brief pause, then everyone burst into laughter.\\n\\nWas asked what language I’m comfortable in, I said C++.\\n\\nWas asked the following:\\n\\n1 ) Pass by pointer/pass by reference, difference, advantages/disadvantages of each, when they are used, etc. I mentioned pointers are used for dynamic memory allocation.\\n\\n2 ) Details about dynamic memory allocation. \\n\\n\\n\\n3 ) Stack/Heap storage sections of memory\\n\\n4 ) Static variables, how they work and where they are stored.

All cycles should be powers of 2.\\n\\nNext he asked me questions related to ACID properties in DBMS.\\n\\nRound 2 -\\n\\nAsked me about my GSoC. Asked me to implement an educational institution in India using OOPS. Asked about access specifier, virtual functions. Asked me some questions related to operating systems (about task manager, how apps contact each other).\\n\\n\\n\\nGave the following puzzle at end - Given a N songs, make a playlist of M songs where each song should be present in the playlist and a song can be repeated only if there are K songs between the previous instance of that same song. \\n\\nCould not think of any optimal solution, just told about a brute force recursive approach with some optimizations.\\n\\nVineet:-\\n\\nThey ask some basic CP questions and then grill you on your interests (majorly DBMS, OOPS and some basic c++ questions for me). There is no HR round.\\n\\nRound1: Was asked 2 CP questions (discuss the approach and then code as well) and a few OOPS questions like virtual functions, The Diamond Problem and new & delete operators (memory allocation).

You have a single core CPU, and are given a list of processes with their start times and duration. So, If the CPU is in the middle of a process and a new process comes up, it will push that process in a queue and execute it later. Else, if it’s free, then it’ll begin the process right away. The elements in the queue are dequeued according to their duration (shortest duration first). Now, given the vector containing the start times and duration of N processes, print out the order in which they all will be executed\\n\\n\\n\\nQ3. Same question, but now you have K cores.

Given a binary tree and a given value, print out the path from the root node to that value. The catch is- you’re not allowed to use recursion. Analyse space and time complexity of the solution as well.\\n\\nQ2. What is inheritance?\\n\\nQ3. Difference between inheritance in Java and C++?\\n\\nQ4. What is the ‘diamond problem’ and how does C++ go about solving it?\\n\\nQ5.Given a ‘Dog’ class with its methods, and a ‘Robot’ class with its methods, how will you design a ‘Robotic Dog’ class using inheritance. Note that some methods of ‘Dog’ class like ‘Eat’ shouldn’t be present in the ‘Robotic Dog’ class.\\n\\nShubham:-\\n\\nInterview 1: \\n\\nFirst I was asked a few questions related to OOPS, difference between new and malloc, \\n\\nI was asked to explain what the diamond problem is (read this article to learn more\\n\\nMultiple Inheritance in C++ - GeeksforGeeks) .  \\n\\nI was then asked a question in which you were given a complete binary tree rooted at node labelled 1. Suppose the number of nodes is n. Any node i can have at most two  children which will be labelled 2i and 2i+1, if they exist.\\n\\nWhat will be the height of the tree?\\n\\nCheck whether a node labelled x is in  the tree. (Try doing it logn time)\\n\\nThis question was slightly vague , but I think the idea was that the parent of a node labelled i would be floor(i/2) , so given the node x you can find path from 1 to x and check the first node not on the path (if at all it exists). \\n\\nI was then asked to explain what  hashing is , do read about hashing from the CLRS book. \\n\\nDesign a data structure which can support the following operations \\n\\nfindmin \\n\\ndeletemin \\n\\nadd(x) \\n\\n\\n\\ndelete(x)  \\n\\nI initially used a set.\\n\\nBut the interviewer wanted me to minimize the complexity of findmin() (do it in O(1)) . They did not care about other operations.  \\n\\nCoding Question \\n\\nSuppose you are given a list of weights w1,w2…..,wn . You will transport these weights in the order in which they are given using a truck. You want to transport all the weights in at most d days. Find the minimum capacity of  the truck that will allow you to do so. In one day the truck can only make 1 trip, if the capacity of the weight is C it can carry at C units of weight in one trip.   \\n\\n(Hint : Use binary search on the capacity)\\n\\nInterview 2:  \\n\\nInterviewer asked whether I had taken the  DBMS course after I said yes , he asked me the following questions\\n\\nWhat are the ACID properties? \\n\\nWhat steps should be undertaken to ensure atomicity? Read about logs in DBMS. \\n\\nWhat are indexes? What are unordered indexes ? Is it possible to have multiple indexes on a particular table? \\n\\nYou are given an array of n integers a1,a2,a3….an. For all subarrays of size k output the maximum element . \\n\\nQlink : (99+) Sliding Window Maximum - LeetCode \\n\\nI told him a solution that worked in O(nlogk) but he insisted that I solve it in O(n), with a few hints I was able to arrive at an O(n) solution . Make sure you interact with your interviewer while solving.  \\n\\nHint: Try using a deque.\\n\\nThen I was asked more OOPS questions: \\n\\nWhat is inheritance? \\n\\nHow is inheritance useful? \\n\\nWhat is encapsulation and how is it used in real life? \\n\\nAlso at the end of almost all rounds the interviewee is asked whether he has any questions for the interviewer. Make sure you ask something in this segment. \\n\\nOverall for DE Shaw if you have covered DBMS as a part of your curriculum make sure you are comfortable with it, also a lot of importance is given to OOPS.\\n\\nAditya Trivedi:-\\n\\n\\n\\nTechnical Round #1\\n\\nTell me about your projects, tech used. As I had used react and the interviewer too worked with react he asked about it a little. WHy is react used ? What states are being maintained in your project ?

I then went on to explain my project which he asked me. Afterwards, he asked me a question, which was as follows:\\n\\nI am given a matrix with n rows and m columns. Each column has a size up to which all the rows are filled with 0s. After the column is completed, 1 is placed in the next row to denote that the column is now completed. And the remaining rows are filled with -1s. I have to find an efficient algorithm to find the column with the least size.\\n\\nExample:-\\n\\n\\n\\n0\\t0\\t1 \\t0\\n\\n0\\t1\\t-1\\t1\\n\\n0\\t-1\\t-1\\t-1\\n\\n0\\t-1\\t-1\\t-1\\n\\n1\\t-1\\t-1\\t-1\\n\\nHere, the 3rd column has the least size, which is 0. So, the output will be 3.\\n\\nI started with the basic approach in which I’ll check all the columns one by one. But the complexity here will be O(nm), which is quite high. Then I proposed my solution in which I took the middle row, stored all the rows with -1, and then in a binary manner, I will find the first occurrence of 1. This was efficient with O(m*log n) complexity. But then, he countered me that if the number of rows is very small as compared to the number of columns. So for this, my approach was to start with the 1 from the first column and then traverse to the next column and find its 1 by traversing up the column until I find it. This approach was O(n+m) and he was satisfied with it.\\n\\nThen the other interviewer asked me the next question which was - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/generate-all-numbers-up-to-n-in-lexicographical-order/\\n\\nIt was easy and a recursive solution was all he wanted.\\n\\nAnd in the end, he asked me some classes and oops concept.\\n\\nROUND 2\\n\\nAt the start, this interviewer also asked me about my projects. After that, he directly asked me to solve a CP Problem which was - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/number-of-square-matrices-with-all-1s/#:~:text=Total%20number%20of%20squares%20%3D%2010%20%2B%204%20%2B%201%20%3D%2015.\\n\\nIt was an easy one but he got disconnected around 2-3 times, so he went on to listening just half the explanation of my solution and then told the next interviewer to ask his questions as we were already running late due to his network issues and he got the point of what my solution was. \\n\\nThe next interviewer straight away asked me an OOPS concept problem which was- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/design-data-structures-algorithms-memory-file-system/\\n\\nThis was probably the toughest part of the whole interview process as I didn’t have this deep knowledge of OOPS concepts and Classes. Nonetheless, I proposed my solution \\n\\n\\n\\nwhich was partially correct but I wasn’t able to implement the essential OOPS concept that was required.\\n\\nDaksh Sharma:-\\n\\nInterview Round 1\\n\\nThe interview started with a coding problem where we were given n files each of m bytes and we had to merge these n files into 1 single file with minimum cost. The cost of merging two files is equal to sizeof(file1)+sizeof(file2).\\n\\nI gave an O(nlogn) solution using priority queue where I popped out elements having minimum size and merging them and adding the merged file back into the priority queue.\\n\\nThe interviewer was satisfied with the answer and gave me a follow up question where he changed the cost of merging as min(sizeof(file1),sizeof(file2)). \\n\\nMy answer remained the same where instead of adding the sizes of both the files in the final answer we will add min of the sizes in it and add the sum of sizes of both the files in the priority queue. The interviewer was satisfied and moved forward.\\n\\nSimilar question: Connect n ropes in with minimum cost\\n\\nThe second question was Generate all numbers up to N in lexicographically order.\\nFirst I gave a naive solution where we will first create a vector of strings consisting of these n numbers inside it and then we will simply sort it. Then he asked me to solve this problem without using strings. Then I gave a DFS solution for the same.\\n\\nThen he gave me the final problem where I was asked to create a data structure in which we can add, delete, search strings and also can print all strings present inside it in lexicographical order. I was asked to give the optimal solution directly and so for that I used trie data structure and quickly coded the solution. The interviewer was pretty satisfied with the implementation.\\n\\nInterview Round 2\\n\\n\\nThe interview started with Find the minimum element in a sorted and rotated array problem and was first asked to find all possible scenarios that needed to be checked. My answer was to check for duplicates, check whether the  array is sorted in ascending/descending order, numerical value type. Then he asked me\\n\\n\\n\\nto code the optimal solution directly. I gave an O(logn) time solution using binary search.\\n\\nThen we had a discussion related to DBMS topics like SQL vs NoSQL, Normalization and its forms, and different types of keys .\\n\\nThen he asked me to design a database schema for twitter’s posts system where users can like, comment, and share a post. After I created the schema he asked me to normalize it too and was satisfied with my work.\\n\\nThen we moved on to another coding problem in which we are given a single core processor and we need to perform k tasks with each task having start time and task completion duration and the processor will process the eligible task with least duration and we are required to print the order in which the tasks will be performed.\\nProblem link: Single threaded CPU \\nMy answer was to use a priority queue for the same where we will put all those elements inside the priority queue which have start time <= current time. \\nThen he gave a follow up question where the processor was a multi core processor and the conditions remained the same.\\nAnswer: We need to maintain a counter which will maintain a count of the number of active tasks which can be used to check whether a task can be performed or not and other than that the approach will remain the same.\\n\\nDeshaw company interveiw questions and experiences 2022\\n\\nAnindya Vijayvargeeya\\n\\nRound 1\\n\\nThere were 2 interviewers on the panel. \\n\\nThe first guy started asking me about a simple dp problem from interviewbit ( https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/ways-to-decode/ ). I solved it easily, then he modified the question to allow for wildcard characters. Took me some time to handle all the edge cases, but was able to solve that too with the same string-DP logic. \\n\\n\\n\\nThen the second interviewer asked me about cache. Some fundamental qs like why is cache needed, why its size is small, etc. Then he asked about various strategies used for handling cache miss and then asked me to implement an LFU cache. At first, I was clueless, but then he told me to start with any data structure and we’d discuss the complexity. I tried out various approaches discussing the merits and limits of each approach. The final answer involved using hashing with a linked list.\\n\\nThen followed some OOP qs, asked about some basics like what is a constructor, terms like private-public and so on. Then asked can constructor be private. I wasn’t able to answer this. I worked out some possibilities but none of them worked so concluded it can’t be, but actually it can be.\\n\\nThen some questions over static vs dynamic libraries (which I had no idea about), how hashing works, and then asked can maps and sets be implemented with both bbst and hashing, and if yes how? (The answer to the last one is obviously yes, C++ has both implementations, but had to be clear on how hashing works to explain it.)\\n\\nRound 2\\n\\nMy interview started with a project discussion over minishell, the last project I mentioned on my resume which I had forgotten half about. The interviewers asked me whether I’m good at Linux, then picked up this project from my resume. Started with some basic questions but then went into details of fork, exec, dup, pipe and other stuff used in that project. I was able to answer giving a general idea but I did forget a lot. For example, I remembered what dup does and explained it, but then they asked me what are its input parameters. No clue about that.\\n\\nThen they asked a greedy algo question over an array that I don’t remember and wasn’t able to answer.\\n\\nAfter messing up the first 2 questions, I was actually able to answer all subsequent ones. I don’t remember all of what they asked after these 2 above-mentioned qs, but here’s what I do remember:\\n\\nDBMS ACID properties: \\n\\nExplain what is a transaction\\n\\nWhat properties does it need to have? (ans is obv ACID)\\n\\n(When I was explaining ACID) Why do every operation need to be isolated? Let's say I have 2 read operations, do they really need to be isolated?\\n\\nI explained reads need not be isolated, but in a large number of operations, we would be seeing write operations too. So if let's say, we get n read operations followed by a write operation and we allow the reads, we would need some mechanism to prevent the last write before all the read operations finish. So as a general principle, all transactions should be isolated.\\n\\nThis interviewbit question: https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/min-cost-path/ \\n\\n(Involved Dijkstra / 0-1 BFS)\\n\\nAuthentication project question\\n\\nSo you mentioned authentication in one of your projects, how did you implement it?\\n\\nExplained the procedure of getting passwords, hashing them, and saving them in a database\\n\\nWhy is hashing required?\\n\\nDBMS indexing questions:\\n\\nEnumerate all the keys we have in a relational database, and their significance\\n\\nWhy is a foreign key required?\\n\\nI answered that would help in cascade operations otherwise if we want to keep multiple tables in sync we would have to manually update both.\\n\\nWhat's an index, and why is it required?\\n\\nMy answer: Since records are sorted in a table using the primary key, if we want to look up anything we would need to go through all the records. A better way would be to build a data structure to help this (I actually kept on saying bst for that data structure name, when the interviewer reminded me the technical term is B+ Tree). I explained the entire working of B+ Tree.\\n\\nSo why shouldn’t we build an index over all the columns?\\n\\nI answered since then every insert of update operation would have a lot of  overhead operations involved for updating all the indexes. In the long run that would slow down stuff considerably.\\n\\nDhruv Somani\\n\\nRound 1\\n\\nThis was an offline interview. There was one interviewer and this interview was extremely C/C++ focussed. A thorough knowledge of C fundamentals was required.\\n\\nI would suggest watching Cherno’s C++ Youtube playlist for rounds like this.\\n\\nQuestions I was asked:\\n\\nIs printf a function or not? If it is a function, how can it take in a variable number of parameters as input. Do you know how to implement functions like these in C?\\n\\nAsked me the difference between malloc() and calloc().\\n\\n\\n\\nAlso, asked me to implement a function which performs the same task as realloc(), using only malloc() and free().\\n\\nHow are floating point numbers stored in memory? (Yes, the COA stuff.)\\n\\nWhat is the static keyword used for in C? (There are multiple use cases.)\\n\\nWhat is the extern keyword in C?\\n\\nHow do access a variable stored in another file in C?\\n\\nAlso, a few questions regarding inheritance. For example, in an inherited class, how do I specify which constructor of the parent class should be used.\\n\\nA discussion on Big-endian and Little-endian byte ordering.\\n\\nCan the same class be typedef-ed multiple times to different aliases? Are typedefs executed at compile-time or runtime?\\n\\nA discussion on macros and preprocessor directives in C.\\n\\nWhat is the difference between #define x 5 and const int x = 5.\\n\\nSuppose you have a pointer to a location which stores an integer of 4 bytes. Now you convert this to a char pointer, increment the pointer by one, convert it back to an integer pointer and read from the memory location. What would you get?\\n\\nRound 2\\n\\nAgain an offline interview. There were 2 interviewers in the panel. This interview was more focussed on DSA and puzzles.\\n\\nThere was a mid-level DSA question but I was required to explain my solution thoroughly and also by dry-running on a sample test case. I had to properly convince the interviewers that my solution was correct, because I used an unconventional method for that problem. \\n\\nI was asked this puzzle: https://puzzlefry.com/puzzles/find-celebrity-in-the-party-2/.\\n\\nA discussion on my projects followed. I was also asked about some points in my resume.\\n\\nDeshaw company interveiw questions and experiences 2023\\n\\nAnkita Kanoji\\n\\nRound 1 : (Offline interview)\\n\\nStarted with my introduction and project discussion, asked me few questions about socket.io and OAuth 2.0 as I have used them in one of my projects and what is the difference between JS and vanilla JS and EJS\\n\\nThen he asked few oops questions, global vs static variables, what is the difference between stack and heap memory allocation, what is bss.\\n\\nThere were 3 coding questions:\\n\\n 1) https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-ii/\\n\\n\\n\\n 2) https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/box-stacking-problem-dp-22/\\n\\n3) Find peak in O(logn) https://medium.com/@feliciaamyhadipranata/find-peak-3a4e894eae4d\\n\\nBussa Sai Santhosh\\n\\nRound 1:\\n\\nThis Interview is for 1 hr and there are 2 panellists one asked one question that is for 30 mins and another asked another question this is also for 30 mins, first question is similar to this one https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-the-point-where-maximum-intervals-overlap/ and made some modifications like queries are given you need to find the maximum possible number of people in library in the given interval in O(1) time doing some preprocessing and another question is, a number is said to be magic number if frequency of any digit in the number is equal to the value of digit for example 221333 is a magic number, a natural number is given as an input then you need to find the maximum possible magic number less than the given number\\n\\nRound 2:\\n\\nThis Interview is also for 1 hr one of the interviewer is having 15 yrs of experience in finance and stock analysis field and I had a project on stock price prediction he asked in and out and went so deep in the project that I even don’t know some terminologies he was using and he asked what is the diﬀerence between python and c and what is so special about numpy and pandas and asked about diﬀerent types of neural networks as a part of project discussion and he has drawn a graph\\n\\nand asked me to predict what can be the next stock price and asked what factors will eﬀect the stock prices it went almost 40 mins on project and in last 20 mins he asked all versions of buy and sell stocks question, complete 1hr on stocks :) https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-atmost-b-times/\\n\\nhttps://www.interviewbit.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stocks-ii/\\n\\nhttps://www.interviewbit.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stocks-iii/\\n\\nSreehari C\\n\\nShortlist based on Coding test , 3 questions where there with time allotted for each question. CF and Codechef ratings were also asked and considered while shortlisting.\\n\\nThere were 3 Technical rounds (no HR) one had 2, and 2 of us had 3.\\n\\nRound 1-\\n\\nStarted with Intro. Followed by 2 CP questions.. both of them were good ones.\\n\\nFirst qn-https://codeforces.com/contest/1841/problem/C (exact same q)\\n\\nSecond, qn:-given a sorted array. Even indices stay in position while odd indices are swapped across the half in any order and exactly ones. for ex: A=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] can result in [1,8,3,6,5,4,7,2] or [1,6,3,8,5,2,7,4]\\n\\n(In first ex, 2 is swapped with 8 (across half) and 4 is swapped with 6 and in the second vice versa)\\n\\nNow you had to search for an element in logn in the second array. First array is not given.\\n\\nFirst I was clueless, then he gave some hints on where binary search will end if we do it on even indices, from there I was able to get the idea.\\n\\nSol:- Do a Binary Search on even indices. Now if the element is present in even indices it will be found. Else the position on which binary search fails (ie l>r) is to say i, then the element should be present at index i+1 if the array was sorted. Now observe the element at position i+1. This is swapped with the element we have to search. Now search for this element again using binary search on even indices. The position where it ends is say x, the x+1 will be our desired element.\\n\\nAfter that, he asked some basic OOPS questions, like what is difference between compile time and runtime polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation, how function overloading works, etc.\\n\\nThen he asked whether I am confident with DBMS, I told him I only know the basics and not in depth. So he asked some basic questions like ACID properties, explain them, uses of it in transaction etc.\\n\\nAfter that I told that COA I am confident than DBMS so he asked about cache, replacement algorithms, and had a discussion on one of my project in Verilog where I had Implemented a cache and DRAM.\\n\\nRound 2-\\n\\nAlmost pure CP round.\\n\\nFirst qn- Given an array of numbers (n<=1000 & a[i]<=1000) and an integer k . choose a subset of numbers such that (a1 xor a2 xor a3…ap) xor k is maximum.\\n\\nBasically we have to choose a subset of integers from n such that xor of it and k is maximum.\\n\\nMy soln:- 2D dp , dp[i][xor] – can either have value 1/0. 1 indicates it is possible to choose a subset so that XOR of it =xor, considering first I elements.\\n\\nTransition:- dp[i][xor]=dp[i-1][xor] || dp[i-1][xor^a[i]]\\n\\nThen find max(dp[n][xor]^k) for all xor such that dp[n][xor] is 1\\n\\nAsked me to optimize space , use the fact that i depends only on i-1 , so maintain only 2 states, i and i-1\\n\\nSecond qn- Asked whether I know about Strongly Connected Components, I said yes and said that we have studied in Algo course. He then asked about 2 algo’s used in finding it (Kosaraju and Tarzen) and told to roughly prove the same( be strong in proofs, he cross questioned many times during the proof when I was explaining it). Third qn- It was a standard puzzle- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-secret-mail-problem/\\n\\n\\n\\nFourth qn- Again a standard problem, maximum area of a rectangle consisting of only 0’s or 1’s in 2D matrix consisting of only 0 and 1. Told O(n^3) first then told to optimize to O(n^2)\\n\\nFifth qn- Given an array of n integers and an integer k. Partition the array into k subarrays (each part should be a continues segment) such that sum of averages of all the part is minimum.\\n\\nFor eg: consider a=[1,2,3,4,5] k=3 one partitions can be [[1,2],[3],[4,5]] or [[1],[2,3],[4,5]] in first case value will be 1.5+3+4.5=9 , while in 2 it is 1+2.5+4.5 =8\\n\\nMy soln:- 2D dp, dp[i][j]- minimum value of considering first i elements such that total partitions is j.\\n\\nTransition :- dp[i][j]=min(dp[k][j-1]+avg(a[k+1],a[k+2]…a[i])), such that k<i\\n\\nTime complexity=O(n^2*k)\\n\\nAfter this, asked about vector class implementation (dynamic array in amortized analysis section of CLRS), amortized cost and all.\\n\\nRemarks:- It was one of the difficult rounds I faced.\\n\\nRound 3-\\n\\nAsked bit about my projects which was mostly in ML, approaches I used and all. Asked which is superior , pandas or numpy. I couldn’t answer that, but after that he told that pandas is written on top of numpy.\\n\\nThis was followed by one CP qn- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47211412/dynamic-programming-and-maximum-length-of-a-sequence-of-rectangles-that-fit-into\\n\\nAfter I told the O(n^2) approach told me to optimize to nlogn. (Just like LIS approach in nlogn). I forgot the approach using binary search and ended up telling a dp with segment tree approach , where we use a segment tree to find the max.(Just like LIS using segment tree and dp).\\n\\nThis was the last round , DE Shaw does not conduct HR.\\n\\nRiya Mittal\\n\\nI had three rounds of interview, the first two lasted for about an hour each and were completely technical and the third one lasted for 15 minutes and was both HR+technical. The interviews were very grilling and you need to know cp, your projects as well as courses mentioned in your cv thoroughly. You should also know object oriented programming well. I don’t remember the exact questions but I was asked 2 cp questions in both 1st and 2nd round which were fairly difficult. 1st round involved questions on dbms regarding acid properties, 2nf, 3nf and 4nf forms. There were some questions on oops. I was told to write a pseudo-code to implement an unordered map. The 2nd interview again started with cp questions which I don’t remember but they were both based on dp. Then I was asked few puzzles, like the ones on brainstellar. Then they asked questions on c++ which were quite in-depth like finding output of some codes and finding errors in the code. They asked about polymorphism and multi-inheritance and diamond problem in oops. The 3rd round involved questions regarding projects and technical aspects of the projects. It concluded with some behavioural questions and few small details mentioned on my cv.\\n\\nAasneh Prasad\\n\\nCoding Round:\\n\\n3 questions were given -1 hr time limit, all were Med-Hard/Hard. However I feel the selection was heavily biased towards CodeForces and CodeChef Rating as they had asked us just before the coding round our CF and CC ratings *explicity* in the form to be filled regarding our basic details and in the shortlist for interview rounds it was quite evident.\\n\\nInterview Round 1 (Technical & Offline):\\n\\n2 Interviewers on the panel.\\n\\nFirst Interviewer started off with some questions on C/C++/OOPs basics and I have written below the questions what I had answered (Some might be wrong ☹):\\n\\nIs C++ a dynamic or static language?\\n\\no Static as once a variable type is declared it cannot be changed.\\n\\nMalloc vs Calloc difference\\n\\no Both are used for dynamic memory allocation however in Calloc that chunk of memory is intialised with 0’s but in Malloc it has garbage values.\\n\\nDifference between struct and class:\\n\\no Struct by default has public declaration but class has private as default.\\n\\nWhat is pass by value and pass by reference:\\n\\no When we pass by value we create another copy/instance of the passed data however when we pass by reference we pass a reference to the actual value and changes are reflected in the passed data.\\n\\nWhat is a linker?\\n\\no It combines several object files into a single executable file.\\n\\nWhat is Inheritance?\\n\\no It’s a relationship between 2 classes where the child class inherits the properties of the parent class. I explained the 3 modes: private, public, protected.\\n\\nCompile-Time Polymorphism Vs Runtime Polymorphism\\n\\no Explained to him what Function and Operator Overloading are for Compile-Time Polymorphism\\n\\no Explained to him what Function Overriding is. Make sure to talk about virtual keyword, pure virtual functions and abstract classes also.\\n\\nHe then went on to DBMS:\\n\\nWhat are relational databases?\\n\\no Databases whose data in tables are linked/related to each other via some constraints/conditions are called relational databases.\\n\\nWhat is Indexing?\\n\\no Indexing is a method to efficiently access the tuples of a Database.\\n\\nDifferent types of Indexing:\\n\\no Primary Indexing\\n\\n§ It is defined on certain ordered set of fields which can uniquely identify each tuple.\\n\\n§ Eg) In student database consider the tuples to be sorted on the basis of roll number.\\n\\no Clustered indexing\\n\\n\\n\\n§ Single index defined for a set of tuples.\\n\\n§ Eg) In student database certain index ‘j’ can be used to represent all roll number from [j,j+X]. In such a case we can binary Search for the appropriate range where our target roll number might be and then explicitly check in that set of roll numbers.\\n\\no Multilevel indexing:\\n\\n§ Having 2 or more levels of indexing. For large databases we can keep a clustered Index followed by Primary indexing for faster searches.\\n\\no BitMap Indexing:\\n\\n§ In this we can assign ‘0’ value or ‘1’ depending on whether that tuple satisfies the field or not.\\n\\n§ Eg) We can have database (Gender, Income>=50Rs) and to Query for (Male & Income>=50) we just have to look for tuples whose and value of the 2 fields is 1.\\n\\no B++ Tree:\\n\\n§ I told him the basics of how it works however I did make it clear that I forgot the intricacies of Insertion and Deletion operations ☹.\\n\\nThe second Interviewer was more focussed towards problem Solving.\\n\\nQ1) You are given N points in the X-Y plane and the distance between any 2 points is defined as the absolute value of the difference of their Y-coordinates. Find the maximum distance between any 2 points.\\n\\nApproach: We just have to find maximum Y-coordinate(Y1) and Minimum Y-coordinate(Y2) of points given to us. The answer will be abs(Y1-Y2). Time Complexity O(N).\\n\\nQ2) If I remember the question correctly it was : You are given an array consisting of N numbers .You are given a number K and you can choose to place exactly K partitions at appropriate positions in the sequence. The value of a particular configuration is defined as the sum of absolute differences between the sums of the adjacent partitions. Output the minimum possible value of the array using K partitions.\\n\\nApproach:\\n\\nNaïve à We have N+1 positions to for K positions. For Each N+1Ck combinations we can check their value (Make use of prefix sum also) and update our answer accordingly.\\n\\nOptimised (DP) à Let Dp[i][j][x] denote the minimum value obtained for array from i->j if we use x partions. The transitions can easily be found out:\\n\\nFor idx from i+1 -> j:\\n\\nDp[i][j][x]=min(Dp[i][j][x], abs((pref[idx]-pref[i-1])-(pref[j]-pref[idx-1]))+Dp[idx][j][x-1])\\n\\nThe indices might be wrong but more or less this was the idea.\\n\\nTime Complexity O(N3K).\\n\\nHe was satisfied with this much.\\n\\nQ3) Implement a data structure which acts similar to an array(supports insert and delete) and gives the first and last element values using pointers and efficient space management.\\n\\nApproach: We can use dynamic memory allocation for this. Keep 3 pointers\\n\\n1) Points to the first element\\n\\n2) Points to last element\\n\\n3) Points to the end of the memory area allocated\\n\\nI told him initially if my declared memory allocated is of size N and while inserting the elements if they become more than N then I double my memory allocation to size 2*N and continue my insertion. If I am deleting my elements from memory allocated size N and the number of \\n\\n\\n\\nelements become <=N/2 I decrease my memory allocated size to N/2. He didn’t want me to go into the amortized analysis of this approach and seemed fine with my solution.\\n\\nInterview Round 2 (Technical & Offline):\\n\\n2 Interviewers on this panel too.\\n\\nFirst Interviewer started off with some questions on C/C++/OOPs basics.\\n\\no What is Default Constructor, Parametrized Constructor?\\n\\no What is meant by static variable?\\n\\no What is the scope of a variable?\\n\\no What is the scope of a static variable declared in a function?\\n\\no What is pass by reference vs pass by value (Yes this was asked in both my interviews)\\n\\no What are header files?\\n\\no What is the diamond problem and how is it solved?\\n\\nThen he went onto a CP problem which I remember was:\\n\\nQ) Given an array A of N distinct integers and an integer K. Find the number of subarrays with minimum <=k.\\n\\nApproach: For each integer we can maintain 2 arrays:\\n\\nR[i] à denotes rightmost boundary from i to R[i] where all integers are >=A[i].\\n\\nL[i] à denotes leftmost boundary from L[i] to i where all integers are >=A[i].\\n\\nL,R arrays can easily be calculated using the stack approach similar to https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/largest-rectangle-in-histogram/\\n\\nNow just iterate through the array and add ((i-L[i]+1)*(R[i]-i+1)) to your answer for each A[i]<=k.\\n\\nQ) Follow Up : Now what if the elements of the array are not necessarily distinct. Now find the number of subarrays with minimum <=k.\\n\\nApproach:\\n\\nWhy won’t the previous Approach work?\\n\\nEg) A=[2,5,6,2,6] and k=3.\\n\\nàPrevious Approach: For the first occurring ‘2’ we will add (1-1+1)*(5-1+1)=5.\\n\\nFor the second occurring ‘2’ we will add (4-1+1)*(5-4+1)=8. So our answer will be 13.\\n\\nBut we can clearly see there is overcounting eg) the subarray [2,5,6,2] is counted twice.\\n\\nàRectified Approach: We need to introduce some kind of ordering to avoid this overcounting. Modify L and R as follows:\\n\\nR[i] à denotes rightmost boundary from i to R[i] where all integers are >=A[i].\\n\\nL[i] à denotes leftmost boundary from L[i] to i where all integers are >A[i].\\n\\nThe strict inequality for L will help us mitigate the overcounting.\\n\\nFor the same example, for the first occurring ‘2’ we will add (1-1+1)*(5-1+1)=5.\\n\\nFor the second occurring ‘2’ we will add (4-2+1)*(5-4+1)=6.\\n\\nAnswer will be 11 in this case.\\n\\nI explained all this and he verified the approach and seemed satisfied with it.\\n\\nThe second interviewer went through my projects section a little and asked me about my ML projects, how they could be useful and what I had in plan and certain learnings via the project.\\n\\nHe then went to the courses taken section and asked me if I had done Operating systems. I told him that I would be doing that course in 5th Semester. He asked me if I was fine with DBMS and I told him I was okay and he started off with a lotta DBMS questions:\\n\\nWhat is Normalization?\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is the need of normalization? Why do we need to break relations into other relations?\\n\\nExplain the different forms of normalization: BCNF, TNF, 4NF.\\n\\nWhat is Super Key, Candidate Key, Foreign key?\\n\\nDifference between char(n) vs varchar(n).\\n\\nWhat are the ACID properties?\\n\\nSome rollback mechanisms and checkpoints in Transactions.\\n\\nHe then went onto SQL. He gave me a table consisting of 12 fields. He told me to first break the table into smaller suitable relations (with appropriate Primary Key, Foreign Key and other constraints to be specified). I did not use any formula or anything. I just used pure logic and was vocal about why I was doing a certain step. It was doable If you were patient and didn’t panic. After that he gave me to write a few SQL queries to be performed on the resultant Database. They were not very complex just basic/common operations in SQL.\\n\\nAt the end of the interview I asked them a few standard questions and we concluded the interview.\\n\\nNOTE: DE Shaw is known to take the toughest interviews. Both the interviews were 1hr to 1hr 30 mins long. They are known to grill you on CS fundamentals, C/C++ basics and strong problem solving. For C/C++ you can use the playlist: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dudnM48yfGUldqGD0S4FFb&si=YT7e6dgR2TYVTS_Y\\n\\nMake sure to keep DBMS, OOPs and COA strong. It’s perfectly fine to not know the answers to all the questions. Make sure you tell them the topics you don’t know (There is nothing wrong in that) because if you make random guesses and don’t know the logic behind them this will leave a very bad impression.\\n\\nKshitij Maurya\\n\\nRound 1\\n\\nI was asked two questions in this round\\n\\n1) A number is beautiful if the kth digit appears k numbers of times (2 appears 2 times, 3 appears 3 times, eg. 1333 is beautiful, 31233 is not because 2 appears once only). Given no constraints on the limit of no., that is the number is given as a string, I had to find the greatest beautiful number smaller than the number given as string\\n\\n2) Standard Interview bit Tiling DP problem\\n\\nAfter these two questions, I was grilled on dbms concepts like keys, SQL queries, indexing, B-trees . The questions asked required extremely deep knowledge of the subject\\n\\n\\n\\nDeshaw company interveiw questions and experiences 2024\\n\\nArush Jain (220101016):\\n\\n\\nThere were two rounds, both offline. The first round had two DSA questions only. In the first question, there were two strings given, one smaller than the other one. We have to find the length of the smallest substring in the larger string which contains all the characters of the smaller string in any order. Use a two pointers approach over larger string.\\n\\nIn the second question, we are given a MxN grid having source at (0,0) and destination at (M-1,N-1). We are also given a sequence of MN-2 days in which we remove one of the nodes as given in the sequence (source and destination is not removed). We have to find the day at which connectivity between source and destination gets lost. I used a disjoint set data structure and considered the sequence in the reverse order to actually add the nodes instead of removing them. The day you get connectivity, the next day is the answer. I was told to actually implement the C++ code so be prepared well.\\n\\nThe second round contained both DSA questions and SQL queries. First question was to find the maximum profit for an array of prices given in which you can buy any number of times before selling. Use max suffix array. Second question was to implement a data structure in which you can insert and delete an element in constant time and print the elements in linear time. Use doubly linked list and hashmap to store the pointer to each element. In the third question, we are given k jobs and n machines which can perform that job in a fixed time as given in an array. We have to find the minimum time in which all the jobs can be done. You can use all the machines parallelly. First I used a min heap approach to push from t=0 time all the times and then taking minimum of all out, add time to complete the next job and push in the heap again. This method takes k*log(n) time. Interviewer told me to optimize this since in practice k can be very large compared to n. He gave hints to do this using binary search. So this can be done by searching over min time (0) and maximum time (k*min(time taken by machines)) and checking at every time how many jobs can be done. Standard predicate function question. \\n\\nNext I was given some data of students and was told to write some SQL queries over it. I don't remember them exactly. They were related to aggregate functions and advanced aggregate functions so prepare accordingly.\\n\\nOverall my experience was decent. But be prepared well on the topics like DBMS, OOPs and DSA as you can get grilled over these topics.\"),\n",

People who were interviewed for SDE role were asked DSA and those who were interviewed for quant roles were asked statistics, probability, and math.\\n\\nRound 1 (Technical & Offline)\\n\\nHe looked at my resume and was going to ask about my Web Development project. I told him that I was new to web development. He said he is a full stack developer and so he asked me two simple DSA problems. The interviewer was talking in Hindi.\\n\\n1. Given an integer as a string, say a, since it is very large and another integer as an integer, say b, find a%b.\\n\\nI told him that I will divide the string by the given integer by iterating through it and the number that I am left with will be the answer i.e., remainder.\\n\\nHe said my approach will work but he wasn’t convinced by it. Even though it’s O(n), it has lots of operations. He told me think again for a simpler solution. I couldn’t and he then explained that we can iterate from the back of the string and can add the digit * place value % b to the answer. There will be fewer operations this way.\\n\\n2. Given an array and an integer k. Find the maximum sum that can be calculated by taking a total of k integers consecutively from the ends of the array. At least one integer should be taken from both the ends.\\n\\nI gave a solution using prefix sum and then gave two pointer approach.\\n\\nRound 2 (Technical & Offline)\\n\\nThe interviewer asked me what I like. I said CP. So, she gave me a problem. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/palindrome-partitioning-dp-17/\\n\\nI took some time to think and analyze the problem and gave her the dp approach directly. She said the solution was good but wasn’t happy because I didn’t start with the recursive approach and then memoization.\\n\\nRound 3 (HR)\\n\\nI was asked to introduce myself and then the interviewer asked me if I had any questions for him. I asked him if he could share his story. He spoke for 30 mins straight and my round was done.\\n\\nVanga Nikhitha\\n\\nTechnical Round 1:\\n\\nThree teams came for interviewing, and I think the roles which we want to be interviewed were decided based on our preference order of quant and cs.\\n\\nI was asked to give a brief intro of myself and then the interviewer started asking questions.\\n\\nThe first question was to remove the middle element of the stack. At first, I gave the brute force approach by using another stack to store the upper half of the elements and deleting the element which is the middle one. He was ok with it and asked me to write pseudo code for it. Then he asked me to think of a recursive approach but there was a miscommunication that I heard that should not use extra space (which is not possible) so I was unable to solve it and we moved on to the second question.\\n\\nHe asked me all the sorting techniques I know and their respective time and space complexities and asked which sorting technique is used in STL library and then he asked me to write pseudo-code for Quick Sort . After explaining the code for him I was asked to dry run it on some test cases.\\n\\n3rd question was to find the kth smallest element in the given array. I have explained him that I would use a priority queue and why I would use it. Then he asked me time complexity and space complexity of my approach and also asked how priority queues were implemented and so when I told him they were based on heaps, he asked me time complexities of Buildheap, heapify. Since we were short of time, I was not asked to write pseudo code for this.\\n\\nInterviewer was chill. As I looked lil nervous at the starting, he tried to ask more about my hobbies and made me-feel free.\\n\\nTechnical Round 2:\\n\\nA quick introduction was done and she has started asking questions immediately.\\n\\n1. You are given a string of alphabets whenever there are same letters colliding, they have to be removed from the string. This operation can be done any number of times. Output the final string.\\n\\nExample-”abcccbe” output would be “ae” since c’s are colliding, they should be taken first which lead to b’s colliding so after removing them them final string would be “ae”.\\n\\nI have solved it using stack and after letting her know the approach I was asked to write the psuedo-code and dry run was made and she as satisfied with it. 2. https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/first-non-repeating-character-in-a-stream1216/1.\\n\\nCan be solved using queue and map.Was asked to write pseudo code. but that takes large workspace when stream length is high. So she wanted me to reduce it by using data structure which can be used to delete any element in O(1) time. I couldn’t solve it. She tried to hint me that linked list can be used but since there was no time left, she ended the interview by asking me if there is anything else I wanted to ask her. I asked about work culture and her experience of working there.\\n\\nHR round:\\n\\nI was asked about my first project on resume that why did I do work on that and what insightful I found in it.\\n\\nThen he asked why I started doing competitive programming as I mentioned it in my resume. Then he asked-which complier I use for C++ .\\n\\nHe found flutter and dart interesting on my resume and asked which widgets I used. And ended the session by asking if I want to ask any questions to him.\"),\n",

Try to use this fact to your advantage.\\n\\nSwapnil Srivastava\\n\\nRound 1: \\n\\nThe interviewer asked for my introduction and my technical skills. I briefed him about my Android projects. He asked me some technical questions about Android dev, like how \\n\\n\\n\\ndo we import libraries and APIs into our projects, and the differences between maven and gradle. Then he began with the coding questions.\\n\\nQ) Reverse a linked list (A standard question)\\n\\nQ)Print the level order traversal of a tree, but for alternate rows, the output should be from the rightmost element to the leftmost element (Again a standard question)\\n\\nHe asked me how the online semesters were going on, do I miss the campus (ofc yes). Was a pretty chill guy.\\n\\nRound 2:\\n\\nThere were some technical difficulties while joining the interview, so I had to wait for about an hour before the interview started. He asked me for my favourite programming language (Java). Turns out he was leading a Java-based team at GS. He asked me for the key differences between Java and C++. I replied that Java is platform independent but C++ is not. He asked me the reason, but I wasn’t too sure. Then we explained to me the reason (Java compiles programs to .class byte files instead of executable files, so the programs can be run on any machine). \\n\\nThen he started with the questions. He said that we’ll focus on puzzles instead of coding in this interview.\\n\\nQ. You have 8 batteries, 4 of them are working and the rest are faulty. You have a torch, which needs exactly two working batteries to turn on. In all other cases, it remains off (can’t differentiate between 0 and 1 working batteries).  Now, what is the minimum number of tries we need to find at least one working pair of batteries?\\n\\nAns. My first answer was way off, I found out the number of pairs that won’t work (8C2-4C2) and that in the worst case, we’ll go through all these non-working pairs before getting our first working pair at 23rd attempt. He asked me to optimise the solution. I tried a different approach and was eventually able to get to the correct answer(7).\\n\\nQ. Given a set of points, find the maximum number of points on the same line. He only wanted to know my approach and the pseudocode if possible.\\n\\nAns. I began with the brute force solution (n^3) and eventually got it down to an (n^2) soln. We also discussed multiple ways of solving the problem, and common pitfalls (like not storing the slopes as doubles/floats because of precision issues, lines parallel to y axis, etc).\\n\\n\\n\\nQ. There are two magicians A and B, and there’s a deck of cards. You and A are in a room and he asks you to pick 5 cards out of the deck. He looks at them, gives you one card to keep in your pocket and lays out the remaining four cards on a table. Then he leaves the room. Now B comes in, looks at the cards on the table and accurately tells you the card in your pocket. A and B talked before the entire experiment. What plan could they have devised? \\n\\nAns. I knew that the pigeonhole principle can be used in some way to deduct the suit of the card and was trying to figure out the number on our card. I was going too math heavy on the problem, trying to create a bijection from N4->N and what not. He guided me and hinted towards an out-of-the-box solution. Came very close to the solution and figured out that we’ll use the 4 cards for 4 bits to represent the number on the fifth card, but ran out of time.\\n\\nIt was a very fun interview on the whole, and I think he was a bit impressed by me changing my thought processes quickly and being able to arrive at the answers based on his hints.\\n\\nRound 3:\\n\\nStarted with my introduction and we quickly got to the coding questions\\n\\nQ. You had a sorted array initially, but it may now be rotated about a pivot. Find if a given element exists in that array. (A standard question)\\n\\nWasted some time due to a small typo because of using weird variable names, so be careful!\\n\\nQ. We have to design a password validator. The input will be a string and must meet certain conditions to qualify for a valid password. If it is invalid, create a new password from the input string by making minimum changes. Conditions- Min 8 length, at least 1 uppercase, at least 1 digit, at least 1 special character\\n\\nCouldn’t complete the solution due to time constraints, but explained my approach to him and he was satisfied with it.\\n\\nPranav Garg:\\n\\nRound 1:\\n\\n\\n\\nI had already decided to try and drive any interview I sit in towards ML, probability and statistics because I am much more confident in these topics. Interview started with both of us giving short introductions with me trying to drive it in the ML direction right from the beginning. He started with the 3-Sum problem on Leetcode and cared more about the explanation and the approach rather than the code. Later, he asked me to write the code in the language of my choice and compile and run the code on a given testcase. In the follow-up, I was asked about the changes I would make in my approach or the code for some variations to the problem. All of these variations were simple and manageable. All this took about 35 minutes.\\n\\nNot a lot of time was left so he started asking some questions on ML. He asked about bias, variance, regularization and asked some follow-up questions on these topics. Then, he gave me scenarios and asked me what I would do in those situations. I don’t remember the exact questions but it involved working with imbalanced data.\\n\\nFirst interview finished at about 10:15 am and got no notification till 2pm which was very frustrating. People who had their first interview after me were called for the second round from 11:30am, so the process was unorganized.\\n\\nRound 2:\\n\\nStarted with the interviewer telling me about himself and gave me a choice between software development and ML and I chose the latter one. This round mainly focussed on CV discussion. Asked me about the internship I had done and then came to one of my projects. Asked questions about the dataset I had used and the attributes mainly to check how well I knew about my project. We talked in detail about feature selection, variance inflation factor and principal component analysis and correlation.\\n\\nThen, he asked me about uniform distribution, just the definition. After this, he gave me the equation  and asked to find the probability of the roots of this equation being real. \\n\\nWe came back to correlation and correlation matrix and he asked a few properties of it. Then asked this question. If there are three random variables A, B and C with A and B  having strong positive correlation and B and C having strong positive correlation. Does that mean A and C have a strong positive correlation? I told him no and gave an example that the instructor of Stat110 uses in one of his lectures. \\n\\nHe told me that I had forgotten to mention one important property of correlation matrix and told me to ask questions, if I had any. I asked him about frameworks used at Goldman Sachs and how people from non-finance backgrounds adjust at the firm.\\n\\n\\n\\nSuggestion : If you want to ask a question about non-finance background, better frame it well. You would not want to show them that you are not sure or low on confidence or something that leaves a negative impact.\\n\\nWithin 10 minutes of the end of Round 2, got a message for Round 3 and they started it immediately.\\n\\nRound 3:\\n\\nThis interview was more of a discussion on concepts and problems. The interviewer tried to make me feel at home and even called one of his colleagues saying,”There’s a person who wants to meet you.” He already knew that I had interest in probability and statistics. \\n\\nHis colleague started with the questions and asked me ‘The Bridegroom Problem.’ She wanted me to explain the approach and we started the discussion for n=3. I used expectation values and came up with the answer.\\n\\nThe interviewer then asked me the expected number of die rolls to get a 6 on top face. Again, more interested in the approach.\\n\\nA question on integration. Gave two parabolas, asked me to calculate the area of intersection. Simple 12th standard question. Then, asked me to convert to double integral and solve. \\n\\nHis colleague came to the correlation matrix and the properties and I again missed one property. I told her that the same question was asked in the last round and in the 10 minutes break I couldn’t find that property on the Internet. All three had a good laugh.\\n\\nThe interviewer then asked a question on linear algebra where there was a shape given in the 1st quadrant and I had to shift it to the other quadrants using matrix multiplication. Was able to solve the question and he was satisfied with the explanation.\\n\\nOverall, it was one of my favourite experiences in college life. The interviewers, all three(plus one) were collaborative and in a sense, friendly. Felt pretty confident about the results and stopped preparing for the next companies. Got selected later!    \\n\\nLakshmi Narayana \\n\\nRound 1:\\n\\nInterview started the interview with the standard \"tell me about yourself\", I told whatever I\\'d been doing the whole time of college including my projects, extracurriculars, sports and all. Then he asked me to choose the profile on which I should be interviewed further, in spite of having sde background I replied that I wanted quantitative role as it is my passion( but truly I liked solving math problems than developing). Then he started with a question which seems a bit intimidating in the start.\\xa0\\n\\nQ1: you are given a population of a microbe and you have to generate the dynamics of its population through the time, given that for every individual of the species they can regenerate into 3, die, stay as such with probabilities 0.4, 0.2, 0.4. Now how do you simulate this population?\\n\\nI have taken some time to think about the answer, at least to understand the question, and then came up with a solution that I would generate random numbers in some range predefined and that I will assign these values to the events given. Like generating a random number from 100, say, and first 40 are reproduction, next 20 are to die and remaining are to stay still. And then that I will apply this rule to every individual of population. Thus producing the model of the population with coordinate set time.\\n\\nQuestion was pretty simple to state, since I haven\\'t seen such type of question previously just like question 1, I took a minute or so to think about it.\\n\\nQ2: you will be given a six faced dice. Use it to find the value of pi.\\n\\nAns: after thinking for a while I came up with this solution to roll the dice twice and plot it on a graph (x,y) and after plotting large number of points say n. Count the points that falls under x2 + y2 <=36 and take the ratio which is area of quarter circle by area of square ratio: pi/4.\\xa0\\n\\nQ3: given a coin check whether it is based or not. If biased how will you use this as a fair coin.\\n\\nAns: straight forward.\\n\\nRound 2:\\n\\nHe mostly asked the meaning and physical significance of a few probability and linear algebra related terms. Ex: variance, standard dev, eigenvalues eigen vectors, probability density functions, functions of random variables and relation to pdfs.\\n\\nThen he switch to probability questions. Also mentioned that I need give exact answer but to give a way to solve the problem.\\xa0\\n\\nRound 3:\\n\\nThis is HR round, so he doesn\\'t take much out of me. Just asked few questions like where do you sew yourself in 10 years etc. And asked me to model number of covid cases in a location. While I was answering he switching whether I play any sports and I replied badminton. Then he asked to model the odds that pv sindhu wins that day, Tokyo Olympics. Then onwards he didn\\'t asked anything much but simply watched her playing the match.\\n\\nNilay Kala\\n\\nRound 1 : \\n\\nThe interview started with an introduction. Then the interviewer asked me about my project on portfolio optimization. After about 5-6 questions on my project, he began with the questions on probability:\\n\\nA) You are given a random number generator that generates random numbers between 0 and 1 and you are given a biased dice. The probability of getting 1 is p1, 2 is p2 and so on... With the help of a random number generator and the given probabilities, you have to generate 10000 numbers which has approximately the same distribution as the dice. Basically I had to create a biased die with the help of an algorithm.\\n\\n\\n\\nB) Suppose from a uniform number generator you generate 3 numbers. One of the numbers is the side of a square and the other 2 are the length and breadth of a rectangle. Which among the two has greater expected perimeter? After I gave an answer to this, he asked me which one has a greater expected area. \\n\\nThe interview ended with which role I preferred to work as an intern in and he gave me 3 choices: quant, data science and sde to which I replied quant.\\n\\nRound 2:\\n\\nThe round again started with my introduction. This time the interviewer asked me about my experience as an options trader. He asked various questions on derivatives and hedging strategies. Then, he asked questions on backtesting and how would you sell your algorithm to a non-tech person. Then, again he started with the questions on probability:\\n\\nA) You are given a continuous random variable X. Suppose Y is a random variable such that Y = F(X) where F(X) is the cumulative distribution function of X. You have to comment on the distribution of F(Y), i.e., cdf of Y.\\n\\nThe above is a theorem that cdf of cdf of a continuous random variable is a uniform distribution.\\n\\nB) Then he asked me to generate exponential distribution with the help of a uniform number generator.\\n\\nFinally, the interview ended with whether I wanted to ask him any questions.\\n\\nRound 3: \\n\\nIt was quite a strange round where 2 people came and asked me about my introduction. Then one of them went on describing his work in GS and the other interrupted him to ask a question to me. He asked, what might be the future probability of a person being severly infected with covid-19 (i.e., being hospitalised due to it) such that he had taken only one dose of vaccine. It was a guesstimate question and they were analysing how I would draw the conclusion rather than the actual answer.\\n\\n\\n\\nJay Katkani:-\\n\\nRound 1(HR round): The interviewer started the meeting but didn’t say anything till 5-10 minutes, he was busy with some other work. Then he asked me to introduce myself. I had prepared my intro short, crisp and to the point, then he asked me some general questions to make me comfortable.Then he asked about my research project i had worked on, we had a discussion on it for about 20 - 30 mins, I could clearly see he was impressed. Then he asked me some questions on my project. His question was a little ambiguous and not related to my work but somehow I managed to answer them. Then he asked some basic definitions of oops with real life examples and then he gave me a situation of what i will do if i am working on a project and my partner leaves in between.\\n\\nHe asked one last question about what role I would prefer :  quant, data science and sde. To which I replied sde.\\n\\nHe ended the interview and asked me if I had some questions for him.\\n\\nRound 2(Tech round):  The interviewer started by asking me to walk through my CV, he was more interested in hearing about my ML project he asked some questions related to same like how Adaboost Classifier model works and how i calculated accuracy of my model, \\n\\nthe he stopped me and said “That’s fine I had some questions for you. We will  now start with that.“\\n\\nQ1 - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-mislabeled-jars/ \\n\\n        It was an easy puzzle but I misunderstood the question a little and gave the wrong       answer but my approach was correct to tackle the puzzle, so he was fine with it.\\n\\nQ2 - We throw a coin until we get HTT, What will be the expected number of throws? \\n\\nsimilar problem :- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/expected-number-of-coin-flips-to-get-two-heads-in-a-row/\\n\\nQ3 -  If x1 and x2 are uniformly distributed in the interval [0,1] , what will be the probability density of x1+x2? ( How will their graph look and why?)\\n\\nSimilar problem - https://www.quora.com/If-x1-and-x2-are-uniformly-distributed-in-the-interval-1-1-what-will-be-the-probability-density-of-x1+x2\\n\\nQ4 - He asked a guesstimate problem -  No of people do VC daily ( he was more focused on how i approach problem )\\n\\n\\n\\nThen he asked me all the topics i had covered in coding and asked me some algorithms if i knew about them( i do not remember exactly the names of algorithm) he just wanted to know what is their applications and time/space complexity.\\n\\nHe then ended the interview and asked me the same question about what role I would prefer :  quant, data science and sde.I said sde again, then he said he is looking for a quant guy not for sde profile. So I told him about my Portfolio optimization project (It was not listed in my CV) to show him my interest towards quant and said I am a fast learner and will learn required prerequisites very quickly. He asked me if i had any questions for him and ended the interview.\\n\\nOverall Experience :-\\n\\nBoth interviewers were very nice and sweet.\\n\\nThere was a little problem with the time schedule. Many people have to wait for a very long time but I got both my interviews on time.\\n\\nAll questions asked were doable. They were more focused on approach rather than answers.\\n\\nIn my interview no DSA questions were asked, they only asked questions on my project, puzzles, probability and guesstimates.\\n\\nKhushi Karnani\\n\\nRound 1: (Probability, Coding)\\n\\nThis was my first interview after being shortlisted for the first time. I got to know around 10pm that I had an interview at 10am the next morning (very nervous). These 12 hrs were by far the most productive.\\n\\n10 am: started with a long wait for the interview to begin. After about 20 minutes, the interviewer joined and asked me to introduce myself, he said that he had my resume so I can also talk about my previous experiences and projects. He was impressed at the end of my almost 5 minute monologue. \\n\\nHe went on to ask a few questions on probability,\\n\\n\\n\\nA pack of 40 cards of 4 different colours (red, green, blue, yellow) are given, each colour has cards numbered from 1 to 10. Find the probability of picking n (0<n<5) cards such that neither of the chosen cards have the same colour and the same number.\\n\\nYou have 2 fair coins and 1 coin having tails on both sides. You pick a coin, toss it, note down the value and throw the coin away. Find the probability that you get a heads in the first toss, given that the third toss results in heads.\\n\\nIn these questions, (Tip 1) the interviewer wasn’t looking for the correct answer, he was interested to know my thought process and how clearly I am able to put them across. I could answer the first question very well (an approximate answer worked) but was stuck in the second question. (Tip2) The fact that I was speaking to the interviewer while arriving at the solution led him to give me hints that ultimately helped me get close to the answer. \\n\\nThen, an easy recursion based question was asked, I had to write a code to find the number of ways in which a person could climb up n steps, the person can take 1 or 2 steps at a time. I was not asked to run the code.\\n\\nHe asked me which sorting algorithms am I familiar with and then wanted me to explain the working of quick sort and merge sort.\\n\\nThat was it for this round, it was 30-35 mins long I suppose. The interviewer was very helpful and patient throughout. He was well aware of my background (non-circuital branch) hence asked questions which were comparatively easy.\\n\\nRound 2: (Resume based, Data Analytics, ML, Probability Distribution)\\n\\nThe interviewer introduced himself then asked me to do so. He did not have my resume so asked me to give a brief. \\n\\nWe had an in-depth discussion (20 mins) about a project I had done during an internship. It was a project based on Data Analytics and ML. Initially the questions were about what I had done and why it was done that way. Gradually, the questions turned hypothetical. I somehow managed to satisfy him with my answers and justifications to cross questions he posed.\\n\\nNext, he asked me questions about uniform distribution, it went from one-dimensional to two-dimensional, where I got stuck, but the Interviewer was very sweet and did not hesitate to help (again thinking out loud got me through).\\n\\nAt last, he asked me how I would design a Facebook Recommendation system:\\n\\nData fields required\\n\\nPre-processing steps\\n\\nPrediction model to be used\\n\\nOptimizing after getting feedback from the user\\n\\nAnd a few more questions on how to use the feedback information to get the best \\n\\n\\n\\nprediction model.\\n\\nIt was a brainstorming round, going on for 45-50 mins. I was happy with the way I handled questions and how the interviewer dropped hints without me even asking. The interviewer said that he was expecting another colleague to join and would call me back depending on that person’s availability, for a ‘quick’ round of interview/discussion.\\n\\nRound 3: (Resume based, ML, Searching Techniques)\\n\\nI received the call in 5 mins. \\n\\nWe started with my introduction, he did not let me finish speaking and started asking questions on my on-going internship project.\\n\\nThe interviewer did not wait for me to explain any of my answers, it was more like a rapid fire round. Hypothetical questions were built on the project that was being discussed. The weirdest part of this interview was that I couldn’t gauge whether the interviewer was finding my answers satisfactory or not, because his expressions never changed. He did not give me any direction.\\n\\nHe then asked me what searching algorithms/techniques do I prefer and how would I search efficiently in an unsorted array, this led to a brief discussion on hashing techniques (open and closed).\\n\\nThe round lasted for 20-25 mins, it was the shortest but the most nerve wracking interview among the 3. \\n\\n(Tip 3) Be confident and read a bit about the company beforehand so that you can show that you have the values the company is looking for.\\n\\n(Tip 4) Be thorough with your resume, they need not just ask about a particular project and what went into it, but also test your conceptual and analytical prowess.\\n\\nAhlaam Rafiq\\n\\nI had a lot of issues initially with the Zoom server they used for interviews, but the HR was super accommodating and handled it. I did end up having my interview more than 2 hours after it was scheduled, everything after that went pretty smoothly though.\\n\\nRound 1: Interviewer was actually super sweet, despite the interview being 2+ hours late. We had introductions on both sides. This was mostly a technical round. GS uses Hackerrank\\'s codepair for coding.\\n\\nFirst question (code): you have a string (assume alphanumeric), expand it so that the numbers represent how many times the subsequent part of the string is repeated (so \\'a2b3c\\' would be \\'abcccbccc\\'). I solved this with stacks and basically talked him through every step and assumption. He seemed happy with it.\\n\\nSecond question (puzzle): this was a variant of the finding the defective bottle out of 10 problem (with coins instead of bottles). Again, worked it through aloud and he was happy.\\n\\nThird question (code): Asked me to code to get max points from an array lying on the same straight line. I gave him the brute force and partially worked through a slope approach. I couldn\\'t complete it but he was basically looking for a slope-based approach and we left it due to being on the right track + lack of time.\\n\\nAsked him a question about lockdown in GS and he was super vocal so it all went well.\\n\\nRound 2: Again sweet interviewer but I don\\'t remember this round that well. Introductions on both sides, then talked about my projects and experience for a while. There was one very long coding question I solved half of. Asked him a question about lockdown in GS on the way out.\\n\\nRound  3: I went into this a complete mess and I was late. HR was again sweet about it and interviewer was great too. More combative this round. He asked me about my then-ongoing intern in detail. It\\'s a research intern in ML so he wanted to know why I wanted to, and if I could, transition from a research space to an industrial space. Asked about previous programs I\\'ve been through (very curious about Microsoft Engage in particular) and basically went through the whole CV. It was pretty interactive but this was definitely the most aggressive interviewer of the three.\\n\\nTechnical questions: asked me about a hashmap and how to implement it. Questions on binary trees: height, time of traversal etc. just as verbal theory and then a coding question which was a basic implementation of BFS. He varied the question a bit: for reverse order BFS and zig-zag BFS. For zig-zag BFS he wanted me to go with an extra stack based approach but because I was able to do it with just a boolean he gave his \\n\\n\\n\\napproach up after a bit (definitely stick to your solution if it\\'s better and does the task.) We went back to general questions about GS, lockdown and stuff.\\n\\nOverall a great experience as compared to other slot-1 companies I\\'d sit for. HR and interviewers were great. I think a major point here is basically talking them through every single approach and being social+engaging. Questions were doable, they seemed pretty open to new approaches and are very okay with you not knowing stuff. Each round was about 45 mins, takes you from about 9 am (scheduled start) to 5 pm so pretty exhausting day. \\n\\nMonika Poonia\\n\\nRound 1 The interview started with an introduction and then he began by asking me about my favourite algorithm. He asked me to implement it and explain the time complexity. Then there were some basic questions on binary search, time complexity and linked lists. Then he gave me a simple question to code it.\\n\\nGiven two sorted arrays, print the merged sorted array in linear time without using extra space.\\n\\nHe also discussed the implementation of vectors as dynamic arrays in detail.\\n\\nLater he asked me some questions on DBMS and OOPs. The interviewer was more interested in real-world implementation rather than definitions.\\n\\nRound 2 This round again started with introduction. He gave me a coding question.\\n\\nThere is a long integer of size 10^14. Find the total number of ways such that the sum of consecutive natural numbers is equal to the given number.\\n\\nI explained the approach and then he asked me to code it.\\n\\nIn the end he gave me a chance to ask him any question.\\n\\nDyuti Mangal\\n\\n\\nRound 1: \\n\\nThe interviewer began by giving his introduction and told me about his work profile in the company. Then he asked for my intro and we also had a small conversation about swimming and Inter IIT. He then gave me the question: “Design an interface that takes a question from the user and answers it. User can enter the question however he wants and you have to figure out what he’s asking and how to respond.” He limited the current question set to telling the roll number of the student and the exam schedule.\\n\\nHe expected use of OOPS, asked about interface and abstract classes and different access specifiers. \\n\\nWhile I was writing the code, he was not really paying any attention, busy doing his own work. After I was done he looked over it with me. \\n\\nThen he asked a small probability question, “There are 6 people to be seated around a round table. What’s the probability that 3 particular people are always together?”.\\n\\nLastly, he asked if I had any questions.\\n\\nRound 2: \\n\\nThe interviewer began by asking for my introduction. He drilled me on my Engage project and asked a lot of questions about socket.io, NodeJS and npm, to the point I didn’t know the answers anymore. Then he laughed and said let’s move on to the coding question. For an input like “2[ab]cd3[e2[f]]” give output “ababcdeffeffeff”. I used stacks to solve this. He stressed on corner cases, gave me a lot of test cases and asked me to do dry runs, almost as if waiting for me to slip up at some point, but he was satisfied after a while. Then last he asked if I had any questions.\\n\\nRound 3: \\n\\nThis interviewer began by asking who took my last two interviews, and straight up jumped to questions. First question was a puzzle.\\n\\nQues: There are two magicians A and B, and there’s a deck of cards. You and A are in a room and he asks you to pick 5 cards out of the deck. He looks at them, gives you one card to keep in your pocket and lays out the remaining four cards on a table. Then he leaves the room. Now B comes in, looks at the cards on the table and accurately tells you the card in your pocket. A and B talked before the entire experiment. What plan could they have devised? \\n\\nAns: So by pigeonhole principle, since there are only 4 suits, in those 5 cards, at least one suit was repeated. So they can decide to keep the repeated suit in your pocket and the other card of the same suit in, say, the rightmost position. Now we need to find the number. The four cards can be placed in a face up/down position to represent binary digits to get the number. \\n\\nAfter this he asked a coding question, but he only wanted to discuss the approach to solve it, not actually code it.\\n\\nQues: Given a set of points, find the maximum number of points on the same line. \\n\\nI gave an O(n^3) solution first then optimised it to n^2. We discussed the approach in depth, stressing on corner cases, and did a few dry runs on test cases.\\n\\nLastly, again he asked if I had any questions.\\n\\nTanishka Gaur\\n\\nRound 1: Started off with a brief introduction. After that, we discussed one of the projects that I had done. My CV majorly had deep learning projects so the project discussed in the first round was that of a custom next word predictor. He asked me some follow-up questions next. One of them was to discuss a model that predicts the number of covid deaths, keeping in mind that we don’t know when the 3rd wave will strike, hence, a straightforward time series forecasting model couldn’t be used. I had mentioned swimming as one of my hobbies so he asked a probability based question on that. He didn’t want the whole numerical answer - I just told him the data that would be required to solve the problem. Finally, I was asked whether I had any question for him, and with that, round 1 ended.\\n\\nRound 2: Again, we started with discussing some of the projects in my resume (both deep learning related). One was stock prediction (which the interviewer had also done earlier) and the custom word predictor model. He opened the code right there and I gave him a full walkthrough of the project - right from data preprocessing till the predictions phase. Some questions like improving the model at that point were asked. \\n\\nThen, we moved on to probability and he asked me whether we could simulate a coin toss experiment with a probability of ⅓ . I asked for hints in between and he was more than glad to provide them to me, but I had to tell him my initial approach & thinking first.\\n\\nNext, the same question but with a probability of 1/pi was asked. Some questions regarding random variables and distributions were asked as well towards the end.\\n\\n At the end, he messaged his colleague to come take my interview so I was directly sent to round 3. \\n\\nRound 3: This was the toughest round out of all 3. The interviewer seemed less friendlier than the other two as well(who btw were very sweet and helpful). He started with asking about linear regression, RNN, bagging and boosting techniques.\\n\\nNext, he asked me a puzzle (https://puzzlefry.com/puzzles/the-diamond-box-brain-teaser/). Also he asked me about any real life application where this puzzle is used. Then he started with lotsss of probability questions (all random variable related and one about making an unbiased coin from biased). Questions roughly covered PDF, CDF, their fundamental properties, etc. \\n\\n\\n\\nShelly Chouhan\\n\\nRound 1: Started off with him introducing himself, the interviewer was very friendly and sweet. This interview consisted of only probability-based questions. An amoeba cell can perform either of the two functions, it can either divide into two identical daughter cells or it can die. He gave their probabilities as 2/3 and 1/3 respectively. He then asked me what the probability would be of the amoeba surviving. Then he changed the probabilities and asked me a follow up question. If I have n envelopes and n letters, I have to find the probability that atleast one letter is put in the correct envelope. He asked me the difference between a random process and a random variable. He then asked me some definitions and theory from the probability course, some of which I didn’t remember. He asked a few more probability questions, the interview went on for roughly 45 minutes. Finally, he asked me if I had any questions for him. I struggled with a few questions but the interviewer guided me as I figured out the solutions.  \\n\\nRound 2:As usual the interviewer introduced himself and then I did the same. Then he asked me how my previous interview went, it didn’t really go as per my expectations and I told him this. Then he asked me on a scale of 1 to 10 how much would I give myself based on my knowledge of probability. He then told me to explain any question for probability I had come across recently, I told him about this one very interesting approach I had read for the monty hall problem. Then he asked me a puzzle; I had 100 people and 100 doors; initially all doors open. The ith person will toggle (close if open, open if closed) the doors which are multiples of i, 1st person will toggle 1,2,3,4…100. 2nd will toggle 2,4,6,..100 and so on. He asked a few more probability questions and then asked me if I had any questions for him. Overall, the interview went well.\\n\\nRound 3:This was an HR cum tech interview. The interviewer was very friendly and sweet, he introduced himself and then asked me about myself, my hobbies, the city I live in etc. Then he asked me what my plans were after graduating. Then he asked me how I would proceed if I had to find the number of trees in Jodhpur. Then he asked me if there was a study that monitors the amount of people getting severely sick after receiving the first dose of the vaccine, how would I proceed. Then he asked me how I would find out how many tourists visited my city. He was convinced with my answers and overall, the interview went quite well.\\n\\nRound 4:This time there were 2 interviewers, they each gave a brief introduction of themselves and then proceeded to the interview directly. They again asked me what my plans were after graduation and if I had any particular field, I wanted to work in. Then he asked me a probability question and another which was its follow-up. He said I had a biased coin, and I had to design an event with probability 1/3. He was convinced with \\n\\n\\n\\nmy answer. Then he asked me if I can also design such an event with probability 1/pi. Then he concluded the interview and asked me if I had any questions for him, I asked him how many rounds I should expect after this, we laughed. Overall, the interview went very well and the interviewers were very cool and friendly.\\n\\nAkshat Arun:-\\n\\nRound 1: The interviewer was not actually focusing on the interview a lot and for the first 10 minutes he was actually doing some other work. Generally the gs interviews are not that properly managed and hence it takes a lot of time to take all the interviews. He then started by asking me to tell me about myself. Then in my intro I said that I was in the qp team of technothlon 2020 and told what techno is in a few words so he asked me to tell him more about techno. He then started with the questions:\\n\\nYou have |x|<=1 and |y| < 1 then what are the chances of xy>0. He also asked a 1D version of this problem initially.\\n\\nHe then told me that, let us not assume that x and y are independent, then how will you solve this problem.\\n\\nThen he asked what is correlation. What does rho>0 mean?(rho is the corelation factor, taught in MA225). I gave the mathematical significance but then he asked me to describe it non mathematically.\\n\\nThen he asked about uniform distribution.\\n\\nThen he asked me about geometric and normal distribution.\\n\\nThen he asked a lot of theory on expectations in probability.\\n\\nThen he started asking practical questions based on expectations. The first one was the number of expected moves to get a 6 by throwing a die.\\n\\nExpected number of moves to get two consecutive sixes. I told him the approach and the final recurrence relation and then he said that it\\'s right and let\\'s move to the next question but the recurrence was very easy to solve so I immediately solved it and told the answer is 42. He then said that it\\'s wrong and it should be 36 then I again told him my approach, he then told me that it\\'s fine let\\'s move to the next question but i was pretty confident because i have solved a similar question long back. So I told him that his answer is wrong with few justifications and then we moved on to the next question.\\n\\nHe asked the same problem with a variation: expected number of moves such that we get (i,i). I correctly solved this and said 7 he was thinking that the answer is 6 but then he himself solved and got the answer as 7 and then he told me that\\n\\n\\n\\nyes i was right in the previous question and it should be 42(6*7) and not 36(6*6). This made a very good impression.\\n\\nHe asked me two puzzles, one of them was this. I do not remember the other one.\\n\\nRemark: If you are very confident with your answer then you can be a bit cocky. But please note that if you are not, then please follow the interviewer’s instructions and don’t underestimate the knowledge of the interviewer because then that might backfire. (In my case I was quite comfortable with  problems on expectations and solved a similar problem a few months back so I told him that he was wrong).\\n\\nRound 2: The interviewer asked for my intro and then started with questions:\\n\\nYou have 3 coins out of which one has tails on both the sides. You pick a coin, toss it, note down the value and throw the coin away. Then find the probability that you get a heads in the first toss given that in the third toss you get a heads. He first asked me to write down the sample space and then i started explaining him my solution by typing on the codepair platform, I felt like he had a different approach in his mind and my solution had a different approach so he was interrupting me and saying that this isn\\'t fine or why this etc. so he was going to move to the next question but i quickly calculated the answer in my mind and told him the answer(I guess it was ¼). He told me it was right and was a bit surprised then I again started explaining to him like I would explain a child, basically at every step I was giving a mathematical justification and this time he listened properly and was happy.\\n\\nHe then asked me the expected number of moves to achieve an event in the same previous problem. I do not remember the exact event he defined.  I explained again with justification at each step and he was convinced.\\n\\nHe then asked to find out the variance of the same event.\\n\\nThen he asked me the puzzle: Two points are uniformly and independently distributed (located) inside a square. A circle is drawn such that the segment joining the two points is a diameter. Find the probability that the center of the square lies inside that circle.This, He didn\\'t give me enough time because he had to ask coding questions, and told me that we can come back to this problem in the end and I just need to tell him the approach without strict proof.\\n\\nHe started with coding questions: He asked a question which involved topological sorting, similar to this. It was a very standard problem of topo sort, I started coding and during the end he told me it\\'s fine, let\\'s move to the next question but still i wrote the complete working code.(took just 30 secs more so finished it)\\n\\nHe then asked a question which basically involved finding whether a cycle exists in a directed graph.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe then asked me the majority element problem(this). I first gave an approach with maps and he asked the complexity so as I told it is amortised O(n) with unordered_maps, he asked me to code this only and didn\\'t ask me to optimise it further. He basically was looking for a linear time solution and not a space optimised solution.\\n\\nHe had network issues and we had a discussion on the puzzle again and I then told him the approach and he asked if I had any questions for him and then in the end he said he had a positive feedback and left.\\n\\nRound 3: The worst interview I had during slot 1. The interviewer was a bit arrogant. He asked for my intro and gave a very weird problem with vague description and later I came to know from a senior that the problem was related to ML which is not my field. He told me that you have k clusters and each cluster has some arbitrary number of points, define a metric for this system(And yes this was the exact statement given to me). I was very much confused that, what\\'s this? I asked him whether I had to code it.. He told that just give a metric for this system. I told him an approach which defines a metric system and he told me it\\'s not balanced. Then I just did one more change and told that this one is more balanced. He was not happy and then told me to find the cost of the system(again it was very unclear to me what exactly I had to do). I defined the cost. I thought he wanted to ask a different problem and this problem is just a basic setup so then I very humbly asked that sir can you please tell me the motivation behind this problem? Then he told me that the interview is over and you can leave.(The interview lasted for 20-30 minutes).\\n\\nI was unhappy about all this. But later from one of my seniors I heard that this thing is sometimes done to see whether you are a perfect fit for a particular team or not, so as my previous two interviews were very mathematics heavy and I did well so they were basically checking whether you would be good for th ML team or not?(As told by my senior).\\n\\nRemark: Sometimes you will face some weird interviewers but you should be able to handle those situations well else that might cost you the position in that company.\\n\\nRishon\\n\\nThey offer two roles SDE/Quant. However, informally they offer another profile in ML.\\n\\n20 min interviews.\\n\\nInterview 1:\\n\\n\\n\\nGeneral chat to know more about you and which role you are interested in. If you want to apply for ML here is where you should mention it. Based on their judgement of which role is suited for you they will send you to an appropriate interviewer. Some questions asked were-\\n\\nLinear Algebra: Factorization of Matrices (Spectral theorem), eigenvectors & eigenvalues(and their intuition)\\n\\nStatistics: Normal distribution (intuition, pdf, sum of two normal RV)\\n\\nProbability: Bayes theorem\\n\\nML: my projects and positions (brief)\\n\\nInterview 2:\\n\\nI was interviewed by a Data Scientist. Basic ML questions were asked on metrics, overfitting, CNNs etc.\\n\\nInterview 3:\\nIt seemed like this round was just a formality. He asked me my approach to an open ended problem (sort of a guesstimate). I think their decision was made by round 2.\\n\\nStatistics:\\n\\nEligibility: No CPI cutoff and open for all branches\\n\\nNo. of people shortlisted for interviews : 74\\n\\nNo. of people finally selected : 14 (8 Boys, 6 Girls)\\n\\nBhoomiraj Patel\\n\\nThis was my first Interview, and had been shortlisted for the first time. I got to know at 3pm during the lecture that I had an interview in the evening at 6 pm. So I was very nervous.\\n\\nRound 1: \\n\\nFirst, Interviewer asked me to introduce myself. The interviewer was very friendly.Then he started the coding questions\\n\\nQ) Merge two sorted arrays without using extra space \\n\\n\\tYou have 2 arrays A and B. A of size (m+n) and B of size n, A is filled from 0 to m-1 places and both are sorted. You have to make a sorted array by merging both in array A.\\n\\nQ) Find a loop in the linked list. I explained Floyd’s cycle detection algorithm, \\n\\nThen he asked On a racetrack if 3 guys are running, each with 1x, 2x and 3x speeds respectively, then which 2 will meet first? I replied 1x and 3x.\\n\\nHe further asked, why didn’t we use 1x and 3x instead of 1x and 2x? means why didn’t we use ptr->next = ptr->next->next->next ?\\n\\nAns: If the loop has size multiple of 3 then this method will work fine, but if it is of type 3x+1 or 3x+2, then it will take one extra loop to find out if there exists any loop, so 2x will be the most efficient in all cases.\\n\\nThen he asked about what sports you like to play, and what other activities you do on campus..\\n\\nHe told me about his work profile in the company, and asked if I wanted to ask any questions.\\n\\nRound 2: \\n\\nThe interviewer was the previously passed student of iitg from 2014 batch, His name was Dipanshu. He was very friendly.\\n\\nFirst I introduced myself, then he went through my resume and asked small questions like what are the differences between c and c++ etc.\\n\\nQ) He asked one puzzle.\\n\\n\\tWe have 10 jars, each having liquid in them. All jars weigh 10 grams and one of them weighs 9 grams, we have one digital weighing machine, we have to use the digital weighing machine only once and find which jar has the 9 grams of liquid.\\n\\n\\tFirstly I couldn\\'t answer this question, then he skipped it for now, and at last when he asked if I had any questions. I asked about this question, he gave a hint “How will you uniquely identify each jar?” Then I was able to answer the question. The answer was we have to take 1/10th of the liquid from the first jar, 2/10th liquid from the second jar and so on. And weigh the total liquid on the digital weighing machine, the weight will tell which jar has the 9 grams of weight.\\n\\nQ) First asked small questions about Binary search trees, then asked me to explain pre-order traversal. Then he asked me to write the Pseudo-code of Pre-order traversal in an iterative way.\\n\\nI took time but was able to write pseudo code using stacks.\\n\\nThen he asked some HR questions like why do you want this job? Why Goldman Sachs over other companies? And he asked a few general questions like how was college life going on and etc. \\n\\nOverall Experience :-\\n\\nBoth interviewers were very nice .\\n\\nIn my interview no questions were asked about my projects, they only asked questions on DSA and puzzles only.\\n\\nAll questions asked were doable. They were more focused on approach rather than answers.\\n\\n\\n\\nKunal Kartik\\n\\nCoding Test-\\n\\nCoding Test consisted of 2 DSA questions, a section on Math and CS fundamentals. One of the questions was on dp and other on MST. The math questions were of JEE mains level, which mainly consisted of PnC and Probability. CS MCQs were mainly based in OOPs and DSA, and a few questions on networks and CoA.\\n\\nTechnical Interviews- GS had conducted their interviews in offline mode in the lecture halls. I had a total of 4 interviews - 3 technical + 1 CV discussion.\\n\\nInterview 1 \\n\\nI had been shortlisted for quant role but I wasn’t made aware of that. First the interviewer asked me a few questions on AWS as i had mentioned it on my CV and explained to me its uses in the finance world. Then he asked me a question on game theory and probability. It was something like I had to devise an optimal strategy for picking a number for a game he explained to me. Later he extended it to various parts like to find the expected score and other stuff. At first I had misunderstood the question, but I asked him a few questions to clarify my doubts and later answered it. The interview lasted for about 30-35 minutes.\\n\\nInterview 2\\n\\nThey started off with some simple dsa questions on array.  Then they asked me my favorite DSA topics to which I replied graph and dp, but they ended up asking a question on linked list :). They asked me to find common node in two linked lists. The first algorithm I suggested was using two pointers.Then they asked me to prove my algorithm and then they asked me to suggest an alternative algorithm, to which I suggested an algorithm using Maps. After that they asked me a probability question which was a variation of the Gambler’s Ruin problem. After that they discussed my projects where they first discussed about an internship I had done in app Dev. Then they asked me a few questions on my project which was the last in my CV. The questions were regarding how did I implement certain features and what optimizations were possible. This was a pretty heavy round.\\n\\nInterview 3\\n\\nThis was a DSA round. Two questions were asked. One was to be solved using stack and other was on Dp. I started with the brute force approach in both questions and later went on to optimize it. Both were medium level questions. The interviewer was quite satisfied with my approaches.\\n\\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/remove-all-duplicate-adjacent-characters-from-a-string-using-stack/ \\n\\nCan’t remember the exact dp question. It was something like an array was given and we had to pick elements to maximize the cost and some other conditions were also given which I cannot recall.  In the dp question he asked me both the recursive and iterative approaches.\\n\\nInterview 4\\n\\n\\n\\nThis round was taken by the MD of GS. He asked me about my app dev intern. Asked a few questions on DBMS. We had a short discussion on cloud services and its advantages (specifically AWS) as I had mentioned it on my CV. He was quite impressed and later said that looking at my CV, I would enjoy working on their projects.\\n\\nGeneral Tips -> \\n\\nNever become silent in an interview, always convey your thought process to the interviewer. Communication is the key\\n\\nAsk for hints if stuck.\\n\\nKnow all the projects you mentioned in your CV thoroughly.\\n\\nDon’t ignore maths.\\n\\n\\n\\nPranshu Shah\\n\\nRound 1:\\n\\nI don’t know on what basis they alloted interviewing team to students, but luckily I got the sde team. It was very chill round, normal greetings and intro were there at the start. I was a bit tensed but they lightened up the mood.I wanted to get more of my interview inclined to the dsa part rather than the projects, as projects weren\\'t my strength. So in intro I specifically mentioned about cp, codeforces and regular practice of dsa.\\n\\nThe questions were like these\\n\\nQ1 \\n\\nYou are given a string of characters, just sort them.They asked me to write the pseudo-code on paper. After this they extended it, what if each character was given different weights, then how would you sort them. Also required changes were asked to be made in the code.\\n\\nThey also asked what was the complexity of merge sort.\\n\\nQ2\\n\\nPrint all prime numbers below x.(Standard sieve of eratosthenes problem)\\n\\nAlso I was made to write its pseudo code.\\n\\nAfter these questions, they had a look on my cv and saw the projects.They asked me to choose one and explain it. I had made an app in kotlin. They didnt go into technical things, they just framed a situation and asked me how could i make an app, what could be the components(various classes and databases as used in oops).\\n\\nSituation was like this:\\n\\nYou have spardha coming up. Each team needs cricket nets slot for practice. Build a slot booking app.\\n\\nRound 2:\\n\\nThere was the basic interview at the start and then immediately coding questions were asked\\n\\nQ1\\n\\nIt was the infinite buy and sell stocks and we had to tell the maximum profit.\\n\\nIt is important to take examples and get a basic understanding of the problem.\\n\\nIt was easily solved using the greedy approach\\n\\nQ2\\n\\nAbove question was extended to like what if each transaction takes some x rupees. So then what is the maximum profit you can make?\\n\\nI tried figuring out with some examples. I got a greedy solution. He presented a counter example. I struggled a bit, and then again gave another greedy approach.This too failed.\\n\\nHe asked me to reconsider it and again gave a counter example. At last i got it, and gave the dp approach.\\n\\n\\n\\nQ3\\n\\nAssume you have a function which gives age of all the people in the world(7 billion, to keep space complexity in mind). You get the numbers one by one, then find the median of all the ages.\\n\\nRound 3\\n\\nThis was an HR round. It spanned over 15-20 minutes. Firstly i gave the intro and HR asked me where do you see yourself in 5 years? As a sde developer in the team or in the quant section.\\n\\nAfter that he asked me 1 question.\\n\\nThere is a string of 0’s and 1’s. There is a function f=sigma(n - 1). Here n represents count of contiguous 1’s, and f is summation of n-1 of all sets of contiguous 1’s. Eg 00111011010, Here f=2+1+0=3. Now you have k flips, maximize f. Flips can be random.\\n\\n\\n\\nVanshita\\n\\nI had three interview rounds for the Quant role.\\n\\nRound 1:\\n\\nI was asked to design the best possible strategy for a dice game. I was given a dice, in the first throw of dice, I could keep the outcome or throw the dice once again and then take the second outcome value. Here, we’ll take the values greater than 3 and throw dice again for values less than 4.Then the interviewer modified the problem such that now I could take the outcome sum in the first throw or throw second time then take the second outcome value or throw third time and take this as the final outcome value.(Hint: Expected value calculated in the first part used to calculate for the second part)\\n\\nRound 2:\\n\\nIt was Coding round where the interviewer asked Best time to buy or sell a stock problem, to design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).However, you may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).He later modified the problem and discussed it.\\n\\nRound 3:\\n\\nHere the interviewer discussed the projects and  key courses taken. He then asked some questions on linked lists. He then asked a coding question.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSiddharth Bansal\\n\\nRound 1:\\n\\nHe told me to introduce myself and then asked me how much I knew about probability then went into questions.\\n\\nQ1. Find the probability that a triangle formed using three random points taken from the circumference of a circle is equilateral.\\n\\nThe first point of the triangle could be anything and the other two points were only one possible pair out of infinite possible ones so it was 0.(straightforward approch)\\n\\nQ2. Previous Question but using integration\\n\\nI told him that I didn\\'t know what exactly he was referring to so he explained it to me and then asked me to solve it\\n\\nQ3. Find the probability that the chosen points are such that the center of the circle lies inside the triangle.\\n\\nIt was simple to find the total number of such pairs for a given first point using integration.\\n\\n(Hint: Assume there are N evenly spaced points forming the circle, then there is an angle 2π/N  between two adjacent points. N tends to infinity)\\n\\nQ4. Given that a person always lies with probability p and always tells the truth with probability 1-p, person 1 says “it\\'s raining outside” and person 2 says “person 1 is lying” what is the probability that it is actually raining outside.\\n\\nEasy to find the solution if you list all the possibilities.\\n\\nThe interviewer was chill enough to explain when I didn\\'t get the question.\\n\\nRound 2:\\n\\nThis round was short and the interviewer took time interacting with me, sort of like HR.\\n\\nQ1. given a string, rearrange it so that none of the two adjacent characters are the same.\\n\\nSimple question, gave a few algorithms to solve it pointing out flaws with each one before giving the next. Then proved the correctness of the final algorithm covering all edge cases.\\n\\nQ2. U are randomly breaking a stick into 2 parts, what is the expected length of the smaller part.\\n\\nStandard probability question.\\n\\nRound 3:\\n\\nThis one was tricky as the interviewer didn’t want me to give an exact answer and just wanted me to give an approach.\\n\\nQ1. how would you store a tree in a disk? (no pointers)\\n\\n\\n\\nThe naive approach was to store each node along with a pointer to its right and left child, this consumed a lot of extra space and he wanted me to find a method to maintain the structure without using this much space, we agreed on using parenthesization to store the data.\\n\\nQ2. How to print a tree diagonally with the elements in the same level occurring from left to right in one iteration over the tree\\n\\nI gave a few approaches but I was missing one key piece every time and finally gave up. He was satisfied with my approaches and asked a few dsa and probability questions in the end.\\n\\nThis interview took almost half an hour for each question and he wanted me to find the issues with the algorithms I made, myself.\\n\\nVishal Choudhary \\n\\nIntern Offered \\n\\nShortlisting was based on OA, which consisted of 1 Coding question and questions of Probability, Stats, and also OOPS. \\n\\nTest was for 1 hr. \\n\\nAll the interviews were offline. \\n\\nRound 1: \\n\\nIt started with an intro of mine, then a basic CV review. The interviewer was interested in the worldquant exp. I had put it on. She asked me to elaborate more about it, followed by questions like, how do you get the data in there? In what form data is represented? Is the data which you have been given access to, is raw data or the encoded one? then asked me to tell about 1-2 strategies which i had submitted, followed by why it works? How does money get allocated? whats the max money that can be traded each day with ur strategy? What\\'s the trade frequency? and how does the backtesting work?\\n\\nThen she said, “let\\'s move onto the questions now”. \\n\\nShe asked me a puzzle. There is a 4x4 grid, each cell can be filled with 0 or 1. how many ways this grid can be filled such that the sum of the cells of each row and column is an odd number, and one of the type same as those are present in the GFG probability/logical puzzles section.\\n\\nThen she asked me a few JEE maths type questions. \\n\\nI had a lot of questions for her, like what does she do as a quant in a market making company? what type of clients do they have? .. etc etc,,, and some more finance related questions which i had prepared prior the interview, at first she explained everything roughly,then she took pen and paper nd we talked about that for atleast 10-15 mins, then she asked me to leave as interview was going beyond scheduled time(it was already 12 in the night).\\n\\nRound 2:\\n\\nAt almost 1:30 am, i was called for round 2. The interviewer asked me to introduce myself with a brief of my CV. My CV had a research paper in NLP (argument mining), he was interested in it, and asked me to explain more about it, about the next 10 mins I explained. Then he asked a \\n\\n\\n\\nprobability question, it was based on linearity of expectations, similar questions can be found at  brain stellar(medium and hard). Followed by a leetcode easy-med question, on each of the approaches I gave he asked what are the number of operations, time c., space c., and to optimize further if possible, and if not possible then why not possible? \\n\\nsame, in the end of the interview he asked if i have questions for him, i asked him a few which i had prepared, we talked for about 5-7 mins on them. \\n\\nThere was no HR round, for some they took 3 rounds, for some 2 rounds, round 1 was eliminatory. \\n\\nfor interview prep:\\n\\nGFG puzzles(prob and logical) , Brain stellar probability, brain stellar strategy, course material of MA225 and MA271. And if there are any ML projects, then ML basics. Try to have at least 1 finance project in CV. \\n\\n________________________________________\\n\\nArush Jain (220101016)\\n\\nThere were 3 rounds. All the rounds involved CV discussion and focussed on Probability and Linear Algebra, so prepare well. All the interviews were offline. \\n\\nIn the first round discussion started with one of my ML projects. He had a fair knowledge in this field so he asked me many questions. Then he viewed the key courses section of my CV and started asking Linear Algebra questions like what are eigenvalues and eigenvectors, how do we find eigenvectors, what are the uses of eigenvalues, etc. I was not able to answer this well as I did not prepare this topic much. Then he moved to a DSA question. We are given an infinite sorted array, we need to find a number x in that array. Start with 1 then go to 2 then 4 and so on, for some integer k if 2^k > x, then perform binary search from 2^(k-1) to 2^k. Time complexity will be log(x). Then he asked me if I had any questions to which I asked him some. \\n\\nSecond round was mainly probability and project discussion. We started with my ML projects and I had mentioned some of the models used by me so he told me to explain them. Then we moved on to probability questions. He gave me a random variable X which follows standard normal distribution and asked the values of E(X^2) and E(X^3). He gave some hints so I solved them easily. Then we moved to my project of Options. We had a good discussion over how Black Scholes Model is derived and What is Put Call Parity. At the end he asked me if I had any questions to which I asked him some.\\n\\nThird and the last round was only CV discussion. He asked me to explain any one of the projects. I explained to him my project on Options. Then he asked me about some ML models I had mentioned in one of my projects. After that he asked me if I had any questions to which I asked him some.\\n\\nOverall it was an easy medium. But it was panel dependent so be prepared well with DSA, puzzles, probability and linear algebra.\\n\\nNilesh Singla \\n\\nOffline interview \\n\\nThere were 3 rounds focussed on majorly cv and probability. In all three interviews the major part of interview was revolving about my experience as WorldQuant Researcher.\\n\\nIn first round he asked me to derive the distribution type of random variable formed by summing the two normally distributed random variables. Then he asked about properties of expectation and variance. Then he asked me to find the expected number of heads required to find 3 consecutive heads. He asked me to tell as many approaches as I can. I told recursion and written recursion relation, a markov chain based solution and a simple counting solution.\\n\\nThe second round was more focussed on DSA and OOPS. First he asked me snake and ladder problem which has to be solved using graph(search on leetcode). The second question was on two pointer approach(maximum water container, leetcode). He asked some oops concepts like types of polymorphism.\\n\\nThe third round begin with a dsa question trapping rain water again from leetcode. Then she asked me a puzzle suppose there are 4 person each person takes 1, 2, 7, 10 minutes to cross river using boat. Minimum time for all of them to cross the river. Then she asked me about standard hr questions.\\n\\nTip: always ask a question at the end of interview.\\n\\nVishal Choudhary \\n\\nIntern Offered \\n\\nShortlisting was based on OA, which consisted of 1 Coding question and questions of Probability, Stats, and also OOPS. \\n\\nTest was for 1 hr. \\n\\nAll the interviews were offline. \\n\\nRound 1: \\n\\nIt started with an intro of mine, then a basic CV review.

This included mcqs on calculus, Probability, Puzzles and CS core such as Data Structures, Algorithms, DBMS.\\n\\nSecond had 3 coding questions:\\n\\nQ1) Given 2 matrices return the Product of the 2 matrices.\\n\\nQ2) Given a NxN matrix return the inverse of the matrix.\\n\\nQ3) Some ML question based on cost function.\\n\\nYou were not allowed to use any of the inbuilt functions such as Inverse function in numpy in Python etc. Most people could solve only Q1 ☹.\\n\\nInterview Round 1 (Technical & Offline):\\n\\nStarted off with some basic introduction. A question on probability:\\n\\nGiven a unit length stick and we make a cut at a random position. Find the Expected length of the shorter half. Pretty Standard question. Explain the basic assumptions and solved the integral and got the answer as 1/4th.\\n\\ni^i was also asked in this interview. He asked another simple Probability Question.\\n\\nNext we moved onto Projects. I had done ML projects so he started off with some basics on those. I had done a project on LSTM so he asked me to explain what LSTM means in simple words. I just simply said if I have a sentence for eg) Aasneh is from India, he loves to eat Samosa. To establish this connection between India and Samosa We need LSTM. LSTM in layman term is a way to connect our past outputs to our current output and how they influence them. We talked about the different gates present in it. The activation functions etc.\\n\\nThen he asked me puzzle; The standard 25 horse puzzle: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-9-find-the-fastest-3-horses/\\n\\nThis was doable and he was satisfied with my approach. There a question on DP also asked but I don’t remember It ☹. Final question was on Probability:\\n\\nGiven two people A and B. Each of them has N fair coins. They both toss the N coins independently. The winner is the one which has more heads flipped than the other.\\n\\nFind Probability of A winning.\\n\\nApproach: We can divide the Events into 3. A wins, B wins, A and B draw. We can say A winning will have same probability as B winning because both are symmetric events.\\n\\nLets say probability of A and B drawing is x our answer is (1-x)/2. X can be easily found as\\n\\n∑ (nCy)2/22n where y goes from 0 to n. X turns out to be 2nCn/22n.\\n\\nFollow Up: Now Imagine A has N+1 coins but B has N coins. Now find the Probability of A winning. He didn’t want me to go into the maths of this problem but to explain what actually would happen to the new probability with respect to the previous conditions. I said the obviously the previous probability of A winning would contribute to the new one however from the previous probability of A and B drawing there would be some amount shifted to A winning since the last flip could end up in A’s favour. He was satisfied with this observation and then interview ended.\\n\\nInterview Round 2 (Technical & Offline):\\n\\nStarted off with some basic introduction. First question was on probability:\\n\\n\\n\\nGiven an Equilateral Triangle inscribed inside a circle find the probability of a chord being drawn whose length is greater than that of the side of the equilateral triangle.\\n\\nMethod 1: Using distances from the centre.\\n\\nLooking at this method the answer would turn out to be ½.\\n\\nMethod 2: Now he told me to try another approach. Think of a random point on the circumference of the circle and try to calculate the same probability. Now I thought of the angles the chords through this point would subtend at the centre and calculated the probability accordingly.\\n\\nVia Some basic calculations the Answer turned out to be 1/3.\\n\\nI was extremely baffled at this point as to how could 2 seemingly correct approaches give 2 different answers. He told me both approaches were correct and asked me what was the principle difference between the 2 approaches. I told him in method 1 we assumed uniformity in distance and in method 2 we assumed uniformity in angle. He was satisfied with the two approaches. He told me that this was paradox and both methods were accepted.\\n\\nThere some basic Probability questions which followed. He then went onto my Projects as I had done work in ML. I had done ML projects so he started off with some basics on those. I had done a project on LSTM so he asked me to explain what LSTM means in simple words. I just \\n\\n\\n\\nsimply said if I have a sentence for eg) Aasneh is from India, he loves to eat Samosa. To establish this connection between India and Samosa We need LSTM. LSTM in layman term is a way to connect our past outputs to our current output and how they influence them. We talked about the different gates present in it. The activation functions etc. He also asked me a bit about CNN architecture what are filters, kernel size, dropout etc. I remember him asking an easy DSA question also. It was doable.\\n\\nInterview Round 3 (HR & Offline):\\n\\nHe talked to me about my life experiences, what I felt about my college, what kind of expectations I had from GS…etc. Standard HR round.\\n\\nSahil Mehul Danayak\\n\\nQ) Estimate the value of pi using an experiment.

After I gave the solution, he asked how a person not having programming knowledge would solve it, then I gave a combinatorics solution, and he was satisfied with it. \\nThen he moved to a question similar to - https://codeforces.com/contest/1365/problem/D\\n\\nI was not asked about projects in this round.\\n\\n\\n\\nRound 2 (Technical)\\n\\nI was again asked to introduce myself, I forgot to include my project\\'s domain in the introduction and was mocked on it.\\n\\nThen he asked me to choose any of my projects and tell what difficulties I faced.\\n\\nThen he moved on to questions.\\n\\nQue 1 -> https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/description/\\n\\nQue 2 was a question that was solved by prefix sum.\\n\\nBoth the questions were easy and I gave answers to them quickly.\\n\\nThen he asked me a few DBMS questions like - Normalization, 3NF, BCNF, 2PL protocol, and its advantages.\\n\\nAfter that, I was asked a puzzle, \\nWe are given a circle and we can put points anywhere in the circle and on its boundary, it\\'s a 2 player game, and we play chance by chance.\\n\\nWhichever play has no place to put the point loses.\\n\\nSo given a chance to start the game, where would I put the point so that I always win?\\n\\nI answered it like this, I would put the point in the center of the circle so that when the opponent makes any move and puts a point A, I will always have a point B, on the opposite side of the center and such that A and B lie on a line passing through the center and I will always win.\\n\\nThen he asked me why I preferred the CS role and not the quant role, I gave him an answer, which he told me he used to say the same during his college days.\\n\\nI had no experience in frontend and backend and was asked whether I was willing to learn it if offered the role in such a team.\\n\\nSo be prepared for such questions too.\\n\\nRound 3 \\n\\nThis round was the shortest one, I was asked to explain my projects and he had a few questions regarding them.

You can go from vertex 3 to vertex 2 and 1, but cannot go to vertex 4. Shortest distance from vertex 3 to 0 is 5, 1 to 0 is 4, 2 to 0 is 3 but from 4 to 0 is 7. \\n\\nSolution: Apply dijsktra’s sparse graph algo in reverse graph to find shortest distance from vertex 0 to all other vertex. This will help you to decide if you can go from vertex v1 to v2. Then solve the problem by applying dp.\\n\\nFollow Up: Assume there’s a halt node which must be visited before going home in all paths.\\n\\nSolution: Let's suppose above problem was solved by function solve(start node, end node).For this problem solution is (solve(start node, halt node)) * (solve(halt node, end node))\\n\\nInterview 2\\n\\nQuestion: Given a grid and a robot. Task is to find the minimum number of steps for the robot to reach from start node to end node. If  0 is present at (i,j) cell means the cell is empty , else if 1 is present then the cell is blocked. \\n\\nEg:  \\t0110\\n\\n        \\t0000\\n\\n        \\t0000\\n\\nStart -(0,0), End(0,3)   , Answer = 5.\\n\\nSolution: BFS\\n\\nFollow Up 1: If suppose you have k dynamite, using 1 dynamite you can convert a blocked cell to an empty cell , that is convert 1 to 0.\\n\\nEg:   \\t010\\n\\n         \\t010\\n\\n010\\n\\n000\\n\\nStart -(0,0), End(0,2), Answer with 0 dynamites - 8, answer with 1 dynamite 2\\n\\nFind the shortest path from start node to end node, using at most k dynamites.\\n\\nSolution: Dp solution was accepted in O(n*m*k), slight variation to bfs, create a 3d dp, state (i,j,k) represents distance between start node and (i,j) using k dynamites.

Time complexity O(n*m*k)log(n+m). In the worst case you may require n+m dynamites when start and end node are diagonally opposite and all cells are blocked.\\n\\nCh.V.N.Sindhu\\n\\nTwo coding rounds, have to code the solution on a google doc.\\n\\nInterview 1(45 min)\\n\\nNo intro, went straight to coding\\n\\nQuestion 1: In the first one they gave a file path and we had to pretty print the path. For example if path is home/documents/file.txt we are supposed to print\\n\\nhome\\n\\ndocuments\\n\\nfile.txt\\n\\n(one space before documents & two spaces before file.txt)(we have to print spaces….I added tabs for clarity purpose)\\n\\n\\n\\nEasy, could solve in 10 min.\\n\\n Approach: process whole string and stop at slash, keep track of the level for number of spaces and keep printing the strings after the necessary number of spaces. Pretty basic.\\n\\nQuestion 2: Then he asked a modification of the same question in which we are given more than one file paths and we have to pretty print.\\n\\nLike for example if we have\\n\\na/b/c/d and\\n\\nb/e/f\\n\\nwe have to print\\n\\na\\n\\nb\\n\\nc\\n\\nd\\n\\ne\\n\\nf\\n\\nWe can be given any number of filepaths\\n\\nThought for a bit…..interviewer gave a hint to use a data structure……used tree approach…..solved partially due to time constraint.\\n\\nAt the end he asked if I had any questions….asked for feedback which he didn’t give since it was confidential, asked some questions about how is it being a googler and all.\\n\\nInterview 2(45 min)\\n\\n\\n\\nShort intro, switched to question, was more interactive than the first interview\\n\\nQuestion 1: You are given an array of words and you have to find the longest chain that is of the form\\n\\na-b-c-d (a,b,c,d are strings)\\n\\nwhere b is a+some char,\\n\\nc is b+some char and so on.\\n\\nFor example if we take [dog, dogs, Don, fon dogso, fond, dogson, fonde, done]\\n\\nThe answer would be\\n\\ndog-dogs-dogso-dogson\\n\\nSuggested some recursive approaches in the beginning….but found corner cases for them\\n\\nThought for a bit…then told we can use a trie\\n\\nInterviewer asked to explain what a trie is, so I used the google doc to draw a legit trie(took most of the time, but was beneficial since trie knowledge was tested)\\n\\nCoded the solution partially due to time constraint.\\n\\nAt the end he asked if I had any questions….asked for feedback which he didn’t give since it was confidential, asked some questions about how is it being a googler and all.\\n\\nSome pointers:\\n\\nNever stop talking even if what you are talking doesn’t make any sense. Interviewer looks at the thought process and guides if we are going in the wrong direction.\\n\\nAkshat Arun\\n\\nRound 1: The interviewer asked for a brief intro and then asked me to come on google docs. She defined a hypothetical data structure which she called sparse vectors. These vectors mainly contain 0 and it also has non zero numbers as well but the majority of elements are 0(approximately 70-75%).\\n\\nShe wrote down 3 methods for the class SparseVector:\\n\\nVoid setValue(int index, int val);\\n\\nInt getValue(int index);\\n\\nInt getCountZeroes();\\n\\nAnd asked me to complete these. There were too many edge cases which were to be handled explicitly by asking the interviewer what would happen if this were the case.\\n\\nThese examples and explanations were not given by the interviewer but i am providing them for better clarification:\\n\\nFew examples of sparse vectors: [0,0,2,0,6,0,5], [8,6,0,0,0,0,0]\\n\\nAn initial sparse vector class will look something like this: [ ]\\n\\nAfter calling setvalue(2,2): [0,0,2]\\n\\nAfter calling setValue(4,6): [0,0,2,0,6]\\n\\nAfter calling getValue(3): 0\\n\\ngetCountZeroes(): 3\\n\\nsetValue(5,7): [0,0,2,0,6,7]\\n\\nsetValue(5,0): [0,0,2,0,6,0] \\t\\t{edge case}\\n\\ngetCountZeroes(): 4\\n\\nsetvalue(6,5): [0,0,2,0,6,0,5]\\n\\nNew sparse vector: [ ]\\n\\nsetValue(1,6): [0,6]\\n\\nsetValue(6,12345678): [0,6,0,0,0,0,12345678]\\n\\nsetValue(6,0): [0,6,0,0,0,0,0]\\n\\nsetValue(0,8): [8,6,0,0,0,0]\\n\\nThere are many edge cases, please take care of them properly. Like I can also call getValue(index)  for such an index which does not exist or the index is negative.(In such cases throw standard error of c++).\\n\\nIn the beginning itself I gave the optimised solution which she was looking for. I used unordered maps which stored the non zero numbers and a variable to store the length \\n\\n\\n\\nof the sparse vector. The space complexity was O(n) where n is the number of non zero numbers.\\n\\nThen after this she defined another function: Void addSparseVector(SparseVector &sv);\\n\\nIt takes another sparse vector as input and we have to add corresponding elements of sv and our current class sparse vector.\\n\\nExample: [1,2,9,0,0,5]\\t\\t+ \\t[0,0,3,0,4]\\t \\t=\\t [1,2,12,0,4,5]\\n\\n\\t\\tSv\\t\\t\\tcurrent class sparse vector\\t\\tfinal sparse vector\\n\\nThis class method also had few edge cases: Like the sparse vectors can have negative values as well hence we have to appropriately delete elements if they become zero.\\n\\n[1,0,9] + [-1,1,-9] = [0,1,0] so here we have to manage our map accordingly. Also she wanted not to do twice iterations so if somewhere you are using two iterations then optimise it to one iteration. \\n\\nRound 2: He started with the questions directly. He told me that we have an array and we have to give the maximum length of such a subsequence such that the next element in the subsequence is one more than the previous element.\\n\\nI initially gave the naive approach of O(n^2) and then optimised it to O(n) using unordered_maps and then he asked a few questions on unordered_maps and the difference between unordered_maps and normal maps.(and also obviously i coded the solution)\\n\\nThen he gave a follow up of the previous question that now we another parameter d. And the next element could be anything s[i]+1,s[i]+2,...s[i]+d where s[i] is the current element of the subsequence. And now we have to find the maximum length of any such subsequence. I gave an O(nd) solution using the similar concept of LIS. Then he asked for it to be reduced to something like nlogn. I asked for the constraint on a[i] then he told me it can be between -1e9 to 1e9. Then i said okay then i have to think something else, then he asked me for that approach and told what range do you want for your new approach, i said 0 to 1e5 is good, he thought it's also a decent range and asked my new approach i gave a segment tree approach, he then asked what's a segment tree, i described the properties of segment tree and advantages of segment tree. He understood the segment tree solution and was happy(Coded the solution here as well), then he asked me to also print that subsequence, it was very simple.\\n\\nIn the end he was very happy and then we had a little chat about google and what different kinds of challenges do googlers face etc.\\n\\nI believe that we can also solve for any range of a[i] using segment tree(something like compressed segment tree is used i guess) and also i think binary search can also be used just like how we reduced O(n^2) to O(nlogn) in the longest increasing subsequence problem.\\n\\n\\n\\nTips: In google interviews you should never start coding directly, first discuss your solution with your interviewer and explain all of it using some sample cases and dry run it on that. Once he is satisfied and asks you to code it then only code.\\n\\nAlso use appropriate variable names.\\n\\nAlways ask expected outputs to clarify the output for edge cases\\n\\nAnd always do the “think out loud” thing and do not stop interacting.\\n\\nDivyam Singal\\n\\nInterview 1\\n\\nQuestion: Given n tasks, each having a tuple (id, queue time, exec time) associated with it. Determine the order of tasks if the task with the smallest execution time is chosen among the queued tasks.\\n\\nExample -\\n\\n[id1,0,5], [id2,1,3], [id3,2,2], [id4,6,4]\\n\\nAns: id1, id3, id2, id4\\n\\nSolution: First sort all the tasks on the basis of queued time. Place tasks in the minimum priority queue on execution time. After the current task is executed, find its ending time and push in priority all tasks which should be queued. \\n\\nInterview 2\\n\\nQuestion 1: Given n cities and m paths between them. Also there are L cities given to which you can’t travel. Find the minimum distance from a start city s to end city e.\\n\\nQuestion 2: Now in the above problem, it is given that it is not possible to go from s to e. But you can visit any restricted city by getting a special pass. Then find the minimum number of passes required to reach city e from city s?\\n\\nSolution: First can be easily done using bfs, just maintain a set of restricted cities. I did the second using modified dijkstra’s algorithm. Push into priority queue the pairs {passes required from s,index}, and solve similarly as dijkstra’s. \\n\\nShubham Shankar\\n\\nNote: In both interviews you had to code on google docs, also try writing your approach in a short format before you write code on the google doc, use proper variable names and write neat code.\\n\\nInterview 1\\n\\nQuestion: Design a data structure that supports two operations add(int x) -> adds an integer x\\n\\nquerynextsmallest() -> When querynextsmallest() is called for the first time you should return the minimum element , if it is called for the second time return the second smallest element , in general if it is called for the k th time return the kth smallest element. It is guaranteed that if you call querynextsmallest() for the cth time then there are at least c elements.\\n\\nadd(1)\\n\\nadd(2\\n\\nquerynextsmallest() -> return 1\\n\\nadd(3)\\n\\nquerynextsmallest() -> return 2\\n\\nNote: Try doing both operation in logn time.\\n\\nHint: Think how you can use two heaps to do this.\\n\\nFollow ups were, in addition to these operations try to support delete(x) -> delete an element valued x and modify (x, y) -> change the element valued x to y. \\n\\nHint : Use set instead of heap.Try to minimize the complexity of querynextsmallest() without caring about other operations.(try to do querynextsmallest() in O (1) and remaining in O(n))   \\n\\n\\n\\n Interview 2\\n\\nYou are given a nxm grid, along with a source point (sx,sy) and a destination point (tx,ty),  in this grid some cells are marked 0 and others are marked as 1. From a particular cell (x,y) you can go to (x+1,y) , (x-1,y)  , (x,y+1),(x,y-1) provided that the cell you go to does not contain the value 1, by paying 1 unit, obviously, the cell you go to must be inside the grid. State the minimum cost of going from source to target. \\n\\nSolution: (Simple BFS)\\n\\nFollow Up 1: Now suppose you can use a magical power k times which allows you to convert a cell's value from 1 to 0 ,  and after doing this you can move to that cell. Again state the minimum cost of going from source to target. \\n\\n(Hint: BFS with modification consider nodes of the form (x,y,c) where (x,y,c) means you are at co-ordinate (x,y) and you have used the magical power c number of times. Your source is thus (sx,sy,0) and target is one of (tx,ty,i) where i goes from 0 to k. Try to work out how the edges will be.)\\n\\nFollow Up 2: From a particular cell (x ,y) you can go to (x+1,y) , (x-1,y) , (x,y+1),(x,y-1) , obviously the cell you go to must be inside the grid, if the cell you go to contains 1 you have to pay 1 unit else you have to pay 0 units. Again find the minimum cost.\\n\\n(Hint: 0-1 BFS) \\n\\nAvula Babitha Lakshmi sai\\n\\nInterview 1\\n\\n3 questions were asked. 2nd was a follow up question of 1st and the interviewer asked to explain only the approach for 3rd question.\\n\\nQuestion 1: Given an input string X and key(variables), value(values) pairs of strings. construct string Y by replacing the substrings(variable) wrapped in % symbols in X with its value. example: \\n\\nX= “/home/%USER%/test”,(key, value) pairs [“USER”=”user1”] then Y = “/home/user1/test”\\n\\nApproach: Iterate over X and add the current char to Y if it’s not ‘%’ otherwise iterate till next ‘%’ and then replace the substring(variable) with it’s value. Here to store (key, value) pairs use unordered_map for optimization.\\n\\nQuestion 2: This is the follow up question of 1st question. Here variables are dependent on other variables i.e a variable can have other variables in the value. (dfs should be used and if cycles found report an error) example input: X= “/%HOME%/%USER%/test”, (key, value) pairs [“HOME” = “/system/%USER%”, “USER”=”/tests”]\\n\\nApproach: This is a graph question. A particular variable is connected to the variables which are present in its value. Here we do dfs for finding absolute values of the variables. Maintain a boolean unordered_map(key: string, value: boolean) which keeps track of the current path. Cycle is detected when we visit a variable which is already in the path. After finding the absolute values of the variables follow Q1 approach.\\n\\nQuestion 3: Given an array of N strings which are paths. print in the format given below.\\n\\narr = [“/home/user1/test”, “/home/user2/test”, “system/tests”]\\n\\nexpected output:\\n\\nhome:\\n\\nuser1:\\n\\ntest\\n\\nuser2:\\n\\n\\ttest\\n\\nsystem:\\n\\n\\ttests\\n\\nApproach: This is an N-ary tree question. the class for the tree would have the directory name(string) and unordered_map for child node pointers (<string, node*>, using string cause two folders/files cannot have the same name). Now we have to iterate over each string and create a new node whenever the current file/folder is not present in the parent directory (can be checked using unordered_map of the parent node using the current file/folder name). Now for printing in the given format we have to iterate over the unordered_map of the root directory and do dfs for each node.\\n\\nInterview 2\\n\\n\\n\\nOnly 1 question was asked. In the time left my interviewer explained his approach to the problem and asked questions on the code. \\n\\nQuestion 1: Given a complete tree and an index, return true if a node exists at that index otherwise return false. (expected time complexity is O(logn)).\\n\\nComplete tree: The nodes are indexed in bfs order and in each level the indexing is done from left to right (the empty places are also indexed).\\n\\nApproach: convert the index into binary number and remove the left most significant digit. Now iterate over the binary number from left to right. If the current digit is 1 then go right otherwise left. If at any point the current node is empty then just return false. After iterating the whole binary number(after removing the first digit) return true.\\n\\nAhaan Malhotra\\n\\nOne thing that Google stressed upon in their pre-inter talk was that they weren’t necessarily always looking for correct answers, but it was more about how you approach a problem and take help from hints. So, its important to start off with a decent enough approach (even if wrong), explain that properly (even if its not a complete algo, just let him know what you’re trying to do at a broad level); and then if you’re wrong and he gives you a hint, come up with the correct solution, explain it and code. For quite a few companies, that should work.\\n\\nRound 1-\\n\\nI was first asked to introduce myself, and my interviewer did so too.\\n\\nThe first question was- given an array of integers, find the length of the longest subsequence with difference between consecutive elements to be 1. I suggested that we could use a hash map, where we store the length of the LIS ending at the key. Recursive relation would be m[a[i]] = m[a[i]-1]+1;\\n\\nHe extended the question. Now, the difference between consecutive elements should from 1 to k. Also find the given sequence. I said that we could now take the maximum of m[a[i]-j]+1, j from 1 to k. To find the actual sequence, we could store their parents. I wrote this code. I could make out that I had made some mistake. So actually for the \\n\\n\\n\\nparent, I had again mapped values to values. So, par[4]=3 means that value 3 comes before 4 in my subsequence. Now, as par[3] can change while traversing the array, I may not get the correct subsequence. I myself identified this error as he went through my code. After a small discussion with him, we concluded one should rather work with indices for the parent. So I said that I will map each value to its index, and then store the parent accordingly. In case values repeat, I would store the latest index as if I have x occurences of a value, any subsequence that can be achieved using the ith of those can also be achieved using the xth (here both elements have come before the element on which I am iterating).\\n\\nSecond Question- Given a set of books, and a list of pairs of similar books (similarity is transitive). For a particular book, find the k costliest books similar to that bok.\\n\\nI said that this is basically a graph where we need to find the max k values in the connected component of the given book. So, I do a dfs from the book, insert the prices into a vector. Finally sort the vector and return the max k elements. He was slightly dissatisfied with my last part. I agreed that it wasn’t as efficient as we are doing extra work in sorting the whole array when we just need the max k elements. I remembered that this used a priority queue, so I said using a pq wont help either. He said that I am close, but it was only after his hint that I could get there (pop the smallest element when it crosses size k).\\n\\nRound 2-\\n\\nAgain, the round started off with me giving my introduction. The first question he asked me- given a list of file paths, I am supposed to print the directories in order (just as they appear on the VS Code editor, with all directories expanded) with proper indentation.\\n\\nEg. Given [/home/me/work, /home/me/play, /home/you, /hell], print\\n\\n-- home\\n\\n---- me\\n\\n------ work\\n\\n\\n\\n------ play\\n\\n---- you\\n\\n-- hell\\n\\nAs the most common way to represent a file structure is a tree, I immediately suggested that we should store this in the form of a tree. It didn’t take much time for me to think that we are basically doing a DFS on this tree. The interviewer seemed fairly happy and asked me to code this approach. I had to write everything, including the struct Tree declaration. However, he wasn’t really concerned with syntactic correctness. After I coded this, he asked me to think of another solution where I don’t use a tree. Again, it didn’t take me much time to think of sorting. The files would be in their correct order on sorting. As I wasn’t too sure, I confirmed him that for string a, and a+b – a would be coming before a+b in lexicographic order. If you have any such basic doubts (I guess we studied this in class 2 or so 😊), don’t feel shy in asking the interviewer.\\n\\nAfter suggesting this idea quickly, I asked him for a few seconds to verify that idea is correct. So basically, if you have a parent directory, it would always come just before one of its children, followed by the subtree of that child; and so on. So after taking around half a minute, I explained this to him as well.\\n\\nThe second question—given an array of size n, we remove all elements having any of the k largest distinct values (not the k largest elements). We need to output the size of this new array.\\n\\nEg.  Given 1 1 2 2 3 3 3 and k = 2, the array becomes 1 1, and output is hence 2.\\n\\nI suggested him an approach where I store all the elements in a map, and then decrease from n, the values of the k largest keys. He then said ok, an O(n) solution is simple- now how do look for a better one. I was taken back, because I felt that my solution was actually nlog(n). I said that it would be impossible to do that, because we wont be able to find the answer without reading all the elements. He didn’t agree, So I then came to the previous point that my first solution was actually nlog(n). It came out that array was actually sorted, and he thought I was using hashing. So I said we must use some sort of a binary search. But, I wasn’t able to think of a solution. After a minute or two, he said that knowing the maximum number, I try finding the count of the \\n\\n\\n\\nmaximum number. I said that can be done in log(n) using bin. Search. He then said that what if we do that for all numbers. Now, as I was actually used to always solving for the worst constraints on CP platforms, I exclaimed that this would be nlog(n), only to realise that it would actually be klog(n) which might be better than O(n) depending on the value of k. With that, my interview came to an end.\\n\\nSimran Garg\\n\\nIn each interview round they asked 2 ques and ques are like one is easy version and other one is hard. Stack and array were two data types from which they asked ques.\\n\\nOne of the ques that i remember is that \\n\\nQuestion: there is some array 'A' with 'n' integers (positive or negative) and we have to pick 'k' number of element with constraints that we can just pick the element from the either end (front or back) and after picking the element remove that from the array so we have two ends again.  We need to maximize the sum of those k picked elements.\\n\\nApproach: I implemented ques using two pointers method.\\n\\nMy knowledge - I have done problem solving question on hackerrank, till that time I did almost all easy question and just started with some medium level ques. and codeforces rating was near 1500.\\n\\nExperience- Overall experience was good and I got stuck at some points but interviewer always helps and if we start speaking he also gave some hints to us.\\n\\nSreshth Aggarwal\\n\\nInterview 1\\n\\nA brief introduction, followed by an easy-medium problem of DP.\\n\\nQuestion: Given a nXm grid, where each cell in the grid contains some stones. You have to select one cell from each row, pick up the stones and maximize the number of stones. Provided a penalty: if you selected (j)th column from (i-1)th row, and selecting (k)th column from (i)th row, you have to drop abs(j-k) stones.\\n\\n\\n\\nApproach: First told a brute force solution, followed by a DP solution of time complexity O(n*m^2), which i was asked to code. After that, we discussed about some optimization to reduce the complexity to O(n*m), but was not asked to code that solution.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\nInput-\\n\\n4 4 2\\n\\n1 2 5\\n\\nOutput-\\n\\n8\\n\\nExplaination: Selecting (1,2) element i.e. 4 and (2,3) element i.e. 5 will give 4 + 5 - abs(3-2) = 8\\n\\nInterview 2\\n\\nThe interviewer directly jumped to the problem.\\n\\nQuestion: Given nXn grid and an integer w. You have to find the minimum element for a wXw sub-grid for all possible wXw grids in given nXn grid\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n10 12 31\\n\\n4 25 6\\n\\n17 18 1\\n\\nw=2\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\n4 6\\n\\n4 1\\n\\nApproach: First a brute force solution of complexity O(n^2 * w^2), but then discussed some precomputations to solve it in O(n^2). We can store the minimum for all possible vertical stripes of size (wX1), which can be done by using a deque (standard minimum queue problem). After this precomputation, you have to do a similar thing with the result of the stripes. I was not able to complete the code in time because i implemented minimum stack instead of minimum queue, but the interviewer was satisfied with the approach.\\n\\n\\n\\nGoogle interveiw questions and experiences 2022\\n\\nOm Gunjal\\n\\nRound 1: (Problem Solving)\\n\\nAt the beginning the interviewer introduced himself and asked me to introduce myself. After that he shared the link of google docs. He wrote a question on that and told me to solve it.\\n\\nQuestion: You have given an array A of n size. Find the no. of pairs of i, j such that \\n\\n                    A[i] - A[j] = i - j .\\n\\nApproach 1: I told him brute force approach like I will check for every i that how many\\n\\n                    j are there who are satisfying the above condition. This n^2 Approach so   \\n\\n                    he told me to optimise it.\\n\\nApproach 2: Update every element of array A like A[i] = A[i] - i. Take map of int and     \\n\\n                  traverse through array A and for every A[i] add m[A[i]] in  answer \\n\\n                  and increment m[A[i]] by 1. Multiply answer by two because (i,j) and (j,i) \\n\\n                  both should be counted. Add n in answer for (i,i) pairs.\\n\\nRound 2: (Problem Solving)\\n\\nInterviewer directly starts with a coding question. He gave an interactive question.\\n\\nQuestion: You have an array and there are some false pairs in them. You need to find at least one false pair. You can give the set of indices to the system and the system will output true if there is at least one false pair in that set otherwise false. If you give a set of k size to the system for checking then its complexity will be o(k).\\n\\nApproach 1: check for every i and j. Time complexity will be o(2*n*n). We are giving\\n\\n                     i,j   so its time complexity will be o(2) and there are n^2 pairs . Final \\n\\n                     Time  Complexity is o(n^n).\\n\\nThen He told me to optimise it.\\n\\nApproach 2: Use two pointers. Use a while loop and check for intervals (i+1,j) and  \\n\\n                    (i,j-1). If you get true in any of the intervals then go with that and if you\\n\\n                    get false in both that means the answer is i,j. In this approach also worst \\n\\n                    case time complexity is o(n^2). He told me to further optimise but time \\n\\n                    gets over.\\n\\nAt last I asked some questions regarding culture in google .\\n\\n\\n\\nHarshita Kabra \\n\\nInterview 1\\n\\nQuestion: There are two arrays given representing two cities A and B. A trader can move between these two cities. ith element of each array represents the revenue generated by the trader if he is in that city on ith day. Trader moves between these two cities from day 1 to day n (n = size of array). Whenever trader change city it takes him one day to change city and he will not receive any revenue that day. FInd the maximum total revenue that the trader can get after n days. And also print the string representing the location of trader on each day.( A -> trader is in city A, B-> trader is in city B, T -> trader is travelling)\\n\\nSolution : using dp, dp[0][i]->maximum revenue on i+1th day if trader is in city A on i+1th day. \\n\\ndp[1][i]->maximum revenue on i+1th day if trader is in city A on i+1th day. i goes from 0 to n-1. Return max(dp[0][n-1] , dp[1][n-1]).\\n\\nFollow Up: \\n\\nNow we are given the location of trader on certain days whether he is in cityA or cityB. Now find the maximum profit and print the string as in the previous question.\\n\\nSolution: suppose if i+1th day location is given and it is  A, make dp[1][i] = -infinty. Follow the same procedures then as of previous question.\\n\\nInterview 2:\\n\\nQuestion: We are given n cookies and m ovens. Also two array of n integer are given first one giving time to put cookie in oven and second giving the time to bake a cookie. Ovens are numbered from 0 to m-1 and each cookie wants to be put in the lowest numbered oven. At any time atmost one cookie could be there in oven. After cookie is baked it is taken out of oven and oven is free to bake other cookie. Find the oven number in which maximum cookies are baked. (m>n)\\n\\nSolution: Similar to meeting rooms question of ib. Take an array and store the arrival and exit time of each cookie. Sort the array. Whenever a cookie arrives give it to lowest numbered free oven and store number of that oven for that cookie. And when any exit comes in array free the oven by looking at the number stored for that cookie.\\n\\n\\n\\nAbburi Charishma\\n\\nInterview - 1:\\n\\nOnly 1 coding question and in the end they asked some theoretical questions like topological sorting.\\n\\nQuestion:\\n\\nGiven two arrays A and B of length n in which A[i]= salary you could get if you’re in hyderabad on ith day. B[i] = salary you would get in Bangalore on ith day. Travelling from Bangalore to hyderabad or viceversa takes 1 full day(you couldn’t get any salary on travelling day). Output the maximum salary you could get after n days.\\n\\nApproach: We can observe that on ith day we have two choices :\\n\\n1. Can work in the current office and add that salary\\n\\n2. Or travel on ith day and collect salary of the other on (i+1)th day.\\n\\nTraverse from the back since it is clear that on (n-1) th and n th day I should work on same place to maximise the salary. I declared a vector such as dp[0][i] represents the maximum salary you could get if you work in Hyderabad on ith day (takes care of all i+1 to n days). Similarly, dp[1][i] represents the maximum salary you could get if you work in Bangalore on ith day (takes care of all i+1 to n days)\\n\\ndp[0][n-1] = A[n-1] , dp[0][n-2] = A[n-2] + dp[0][n-1]\\n\\ndp[1][n-1] = B[n-1] , dp[1][n-2] = B[n-2] + dp[1][n-1]\\n\\nSo it is dp[0][i] = max(A[i] + dp[0][i+1],A[i] + dp[1][i+2]) and\\n\\ndp[1][i] = max(B[i]+dp[1][i+1],B[i] + dp[0][i+2]) for all i=n-3 to 0\\n\\nSo my final answer would be max(dp[0][0], dp[1][0]) i.e maximum salary I would get , if started from Hyderabad or bangalore. Time complexity: O(n) , Space Complexity : O(n)\\n\\nInterview – 2:\\n\\nQuestion:\\n\\nGiven a tree in which a node represents a manager for all subordinates in its subtree. Node stores the salary of that employee. Count the number of managers who were underpaid. i.e average salary of subordinates in its subtree is greater than salary of that manager.\\n\\nApproach:\\n\\nWe can solve this using slight modification of dfs by maintaining sum of salaries and count of\\n\\nnumber of employees in subtree of a particular node. We maintain a global variable finalcount which stores the number of managers who were underpaid, i.e. if average is greater than that of a particular node salary. In the end we just return the finalcount. Time complexity would be O(n) and space complexity is O(1) (if recursion is not considered). At the end of each interview we should explain the code along with the dryrun of testcases provided. For any clarifications or assumptions we can freely communicate with the interviewer. Start explaining your approach from the very beginning so that interviewer would be in phase with you to help if you are struck at any stage. In the end I asked some questions about google and what are their expectations as an intern there.\\n\\n\\n\\nGoogle interveiw questions and experiences 2023\\n\\nAnkita Kanoji\\n\\nRound 1:\\n\\nInterviewer asked me for my introduction and started with a coding question.\\n\\nQuestion:\\n\\nGiven a tree in which a node represents a manager for all subordinates in its subtree. Node stores the salary of that employee. Count the number of managers who were underpaid. i.e average salary of subordinates in its subtree is greater than salary of that manager.\\n\\nFirst follow up:\\n\\nTry to use O(1) space instead of O(n)\\n\\nGive the minimum amount of money required to satisfy all underpaid managers.\\n\\nSecond follow-up:\\n\\nInstead of average, if the median of subordinates is greater than manager’s salary then manager is said to be underpaid.\\n\\nQuestion 2:\\n\\nOnly 5 minutes were left, interviewer just wanted the approach of the problem.\\n\\nGiven a classroom of size N x M, in which an exam is being conducted, the probability of\\n\\npassing a chit without being caught between any two adjacent horizontal and vertical cell is given. Given the source and destination, find the maximum probability with which a chit could be passed along any valid path.\\n\\nRound 2:\\n\\nInterviewer didn’t even ask for my introduction he was already late by 5 minutes he directly started to write a question in the shared doc.\\n\\nQuestion 1:\\n\\nGiven the group chat, give the chattiest person’s name.\\n\\nFollow up:\\n\\nGive top k chattiest people in the group.\\n\\nQuestion 2:\\n\\nYou’ll be given a stream of numbers, at every input tell whether there exists a triplet such that the pairwise difference of all the 3 elements of the triplet is atmost d.\\n\\nSarvesh Gholap\\n\\nRound 1:\\n\\nFirst, the interviewer introduced himself and asked me to introduce myself. After the\\n\\nintroduction, he wrote a question on the doc provided earlier.\\n\\nQuestion: Given an array of stock prices, at time 0, 1, 2, etc. find the maximum time\\n\\ninterval for which the stock’s price has fallen.\\n\\n\\n\\nInitially I told him the brute force approach that we’ll compare for all pairs of i’s and j’s and\\n\\ntake the maximum of j-i (j>i) among all the falling prices. He told me to implement it(to write\\n\\nthe function in the doc).\\n\\nThen he told me to optimize the solution. Then I told him that we’ll make a vector of pairs\\n\\n{price[i], i} and sort the vector. Then we’ll check what is the maximum value till any index of\\n\\nsecond element of the pair and take maximum of the difference of the maximum till now and\\n\\ncurrent index’s second element. He told me to write a function for that.\\n\\nThen he told me to dry run my solution on few testcases. After that he was satisfied that the\\n\\nsolution is correct.\\n\\nThen I asked few questions about work culture in google.\\n\\nRound 2:\\n\\nQuestion: Given an array of non negative integers, if we are at any index, then we\\n\\ncan jump exactly the number of steps as given in the array at that index. Then starting from\\n\\nfirst first index, can we reach the last index?\\n\\nI told him the approach. Start from the first index. Update the current index by currentindex +\\n\\njump[currentindex]. If it reaches the last index then return true. Else if it exceeds the size,\\n\\nreturn false. Then he told me to implement the solution.\\n\\nFollow up: Now the array can have negative integers as well. On encountering\\n\\nnegative value, we have to go that many steps backwards.\\n\\nI said that we’ll keep an array indiating whether that index is already visited. If it’s already\\n\\nvisited then we’re stuck in a loop and we have to return false. Rest of the logic is same. He\\n\\ntold me to implement this.\\n\\nThen he said that visited array is taking extra O(n) space. How can we reduce it?\\n\\nI told him other approaches that we can use set, map, graph. Etc. but all of them don’t\\n\\nimprove the space complexity. The I told him that we’ll use Floyd’s cycle detection algorithm\\n\\nto find the cycle.\\n\\nFollow up: Now on seeing a value at any index, we can either go that many steps\\n\\nforward or backward.\\n\\nI said we’ll use dp. But then he told me that it’ll cause recursion loop. Then I said we have to\\n\\nconvert it to graph. But time was over so we wrapped up the interview\\n\\nSoumyadeep Paul\\n\\nCoding round -\\n\\n1. 2 moderate coding questions - one dp and one graph\\n\\n2. Common coding round of some colleges together. IIT KGP and Dhanbad people also got the same questions this time and in the past years also.\\n\\n\\n\\nInterview rounds -\\n\\nBoth rounds were problem solving. Gave a simple introduction and started the question. Had to code in their own virtual interview platform.\\n\\nRound 1-\\n\\nQuestion - Find the largest odd element in an array of positive integers\\n\\nResponse - Gave a c++ code and he moved on\\n\\nFollow Up - Extend it to handle negative integers\\n\\nResponse - Initial code handled that anyway so just explained how both positive and negative values will give correct ans\\n\\nFollow up - Find the kth largest odd element.\\n\\nResponse - Explained the blum et al algorithms( course material ) and then explained how to use that to divide the array in two and find ans in a manner similar to quicksort (kth order statistics). Explained the time complexity analysis of blum et al and then of my algorithm to find the kth largest\\n\\nFollow up - We were nearing the end time so just asked me to write a pseudocode for my approach and then write a working code for any other method I could think of.\\n\\nResponse - Gave the pseudocode and then explained how we can use a heap and get O(nlogk) time, then coded using priority queue\\n\\nDidn't have any time left so he just asked if I had any questions then moved on.\\n\\nRound 2 -\\n\\nQuestion - Given a list of all the words in an English dictionary, find all the combinations of five lettered words that use up 25 distinct letters.\\n\\nResponse - First extract all the five lettered words having all letters distinct. Then use 5 nested for loops and check for all five word combinations. Make a check function to check if the combination uses 25 alphabets or not. O(n^5) solution\\n\\nFollow Up - Improve the time complexity constant\\n\\nResponse - Make the 5 lettered words as integers(bit masking kind of) and xor the combination to check how many ones are there. Coded in C++.\\n\\nFollow up - Then asked a general question only for pseudocode. Given that you have made the list of all combinations, how will you make meaningful sentences\\n\\nResponse - Explained that we can check for all the permutations of a given list of words to see deterministically if they follow all the english grammar rules or not. Can also use recursion to store property of the starting words and then call the function on the remaining part of the sentence. He was just looking for an approach so after this he moved on to the next question.\\n\\nFollow up - If you can use any number of words and have to make lists of words following certain conditions how can you make the list.\\n\\nResponse - Count from 0 to 2^n then take all the words that have one in their position and check for the condition given. Again he just wanted some idea so just explained and discussed a bit more.\\n\\nAt the end, he asked if I had any questions. I asked which section he worked in(Youtube and something) and then asked what languages are primarily used there and some features of youtube that I liked and stuff.\\n\\nOverall Experience -\\n\\n\\n\\nBoth the Interviewers were pretty chill. Doing some standard DSA questions should be fine. Be sure to speak out your approach and explain your thought process\\n\\nAasneh Prasad\\n\\nCoding Round:\\n\\n2 questions were asked for 1 hour time limit:\\n\\nQ1) You are given NxN grid G and each cell of the grid contains an integer. In one step you can travel from any cell Gi1,j1 to Gi2,j2 if abs(j1-j2)+abs(i1-i2) ≤p at a cost of floor(√Gi1,j1 ) where is p is the number of unique factors of integer at Gi1,j1. Determine the minimum cost to travel from G1,1 to GN,N in any number of steps.\\n\\nConstraints: N≤1000, Gi,j ≤1e6.\\n\\nApproach: It’s a question based on Dijkstra’s Algorithm. Firstly store the number of unique factors for each number from 1à1e6. Now push (1,1) into your priority queue initially and it’s distance initialised to 0. Now every time you pop the element with least distance in queue iterate over all possible coordinates reachable from it and add the cost accordingly and decide whether to push it in queue or not.\\n\\nThis question was implementation heavy and make sure to write the code neatly. I was making some silly errors while coding up the solution. Constraints were tight as while storing your distance in traditional map gave TLE for some Test cases while using a 2-d vector or unordered map passed due to difference in log(N) factor. Q2) Broken Toys: https://discuss.codechef.com/t/google-coding-problem-help/95356/3\\n\\nThere exists some binary Search + Greedy solution for this. I didn’t have much time to attempt this question so I just did Brute force and passed half of the test cases.\\n\\nGuys who did 1.5+ questions were mostly shortlisted.\\n\\nInterview Round 1 (Technical & Online):\\n\\nQ1) You are given a number and a mapping of each digit to a character. You are given a list of strings find if any of the strings exists as a substring of the mapping.\\n\\nApproach: He just wanted the Brute force Solution. Get the required string. For each string in list you can check if there is a substring in our required string. He asked me to code it up and I did so.\\n\\nFollow Up 1: Find the string in list with maximum length and exists as substring in the required string.\\n\\nApproach: Similar approach. Just keep another variable to keep track of the maximum length string which satisfies these required conditions.\\n\\nFollow Up 2: I don’t remember this exactly but we had to do something with Tries data structure. He didn’t ask me to code it, I just had to explain him the approach.\\n\\n\\n\\nQ2) You are given certain directories and paths. Find and return such children nodes that have same name as in some ancestor.\\n\\nEg) /home/Kevin/Sam/Kevin\\n\\n/Sandy/Aasneh/Aasneh\\n\\nReturn [Kevin,Aasneh]\\n\\nApproach: A simple DFS type traversal will work for this case. Just maintain a visited array and if at any point for a node you come across it’s children that has already been visited but is not it’s parent it has to be pushed in our answer.\\n\\nInterview Round 2 (Technical & Online):\\n\\nQ) You are given a set of M strict inequalities (<, >) only between certain variables and you have to output if the set of inequalities are satisfiable or not.\\n\\nEg) [(x>y), (y>z), (x>z)]àreturn True.\\n\\nEg) [(x>y), (y>x)]àreturn False.\\n\\nConstraints: M=1e5.\\n\\nApproach: Consider the number of distinct variables to be N (N ≤ 2*M). For each inequality of form (x>y) introduce a directed edge from x à y. Now we just have to perform a DFS on a Directed graph and see if there exists any cycle. If there does à output False,\\n\\nelse output àTrue. I was asked to prove this fac. This can be proved via Contradiction. Assume two variables x, y are the ones violating the set. That means there will be set of edges from xày as (x>y) and yàx as (y>x). This means there will be cycle in the graph à contradictory to our assumption. Time Complexity à O(N+M). I had to code this up.\\n\\nFollow Up: Now there can be numbers also introduced in the inequalities. Output if the set of inequalities are satisfiable or not.\\n\\nEg) [(x>y),(y>3),(x>5)]àreturn True.\\n\\nEg)[(x>3),(2>x)]àreturn True.\\n\\nApproach: First I proposed a solution, similar to previous one in this I would treat variables and numbers as same but I would introduce extra edges between number in their sorted order. This would just add an extra Log(N) factor to the Time Complexity of the previous Solution. He said he the Log(N) factor was not desirable. This meant I don’t have to sort or do anything just make some changes in my DFS call. Then it struck me we should always start our DFS from nodes with indegree=0. Pass another variable in DFS call which denotes the highest number >= all nodes visited till now. If we come across a cycle or an integer which is greater than this number during our DFS we outputàFalse, else output àTrue.\\n\\nI was asked to code this up.\\n\\nIn all Google interviewers were really friendly and helpful. Google appreciates neat and clean code. We were advised to use appropriate variable and function names also. We were allowed to give out interviews even in informal wear.\\n\\nShally Kandoi\\n\\nCoded on a shared doc. No checking by running on test cases. Only dry run.\\n\\nRound 1: (Technical)\\n\\nStarted with intro.\\n\\nQ. Find largest odd integer in a given array\\n\\nGave solution with time complexity of O(n)\\n\\n\\n\\nFollow-up: Find kth largest odd integer in the array\\n\\nGave solution with time complexity of O(nlogn)\\n\\nFollow-up: Optimize time complexity to O(nlogk)\\n\\nSolved used min priority queue limiting its size to only k elements. Answer would be the top element in the queue.\\n\\nEnded with asking some questions to interviewer, asking them about their experience at google, etc\\n\\nRound 2: (Technical)\\n\\nNo intro. Directly asked a problem on trees which I solved using dfs(recursion) .\\n\\nQ. Given a tree (not necessarily binary tree), each node can have any number of children where a node represents a manager and the child nodes represent employees directly working under him. Find the number of managers who are underpaid, i.e., their salary is less than the average salary of all direct and indirect employees working under them.\\n\\nSolved using recursion, every time returning a pair that stores sum of salaries of employees and total number of employees and having a global variable storing the count of underpaid managers. Discussed time and space complexity of this solution.\\n\\nEnded with asking some questions to interviewer, asking them about their experience at google, etc\\n\\nShivam Agrawal\\n\\nThere were two rounds of interviews (both technical). First round was mostly CP related, and the second involved DSA.\\n\\nInterview 1:\\n\\nI started with my introduction, and then I was shared a google doc link. The interviewer wrote the question on it, and asked me to code it below the question.The first question was to find the longest substring with a given character in the string. I just made a count variable to keep track of the length and stored the maximum of all such lengths in another variable. I first asked him about some assumptions, like what if the string is empty, or the given character is not present in the string, and then went on to explain my approach. Then he modified the question and asked to solve it for q such queries. I used a map to precompute the count for each character. He was satisfied with my answer. Then he again modified the question and asked the maximum possible length if we can change at most m characters. I told him the approach but could not code it completely due to lack of time. But he said he was satisfied with my approach.\\n\\nInterview 2:\\n\\nWe started with our introductions and again a google doc was shared. He gave a question related to finding chain lengths in trees. It was a bit complex to understand so I clarified all my doubts, and then told him my approach. He told me to code it, and I was able to do that easily. He then asked another question where he gave some ranges of IP addresses of cities and asked me to find if a given IP address belongs to any of them. I first converted the IP addresses to integers and then I told an O(n) approach to check it. He then asked me to solve it for q queries. He hinted that I can do some modifications to the addresses. So I sorted the vector and told to apply binary search. I could not code it completely due to lack of time but he was satisfied with my approach.\\n\\nSanjana Kolisetty\\n\\nThey sent a link to an interview document and we had to code our solutions in it.\\n\\nRound 1 (Technical & Online)\\n\\nThe usual introduction and my interviewer graduated from college one year ago. He was very chill. I was asked one question and a follow-up.\\n\\nProblem: Given a stream of integers and an integer k, find the moving average of the last k numbers. If the number of integers received so far are less than k, output -1.\\n\\nSolution:\\n\\nLet’s take a simple testcase first.\\n\\nLet the stream of numbers be 1, 2, 5, 3, 6, 2, 7, 1, 2 and k = 4\\n\\n> 1 -> output = -1\\n\\n> 1, 2 -> output = -1\\n\\n> 1, 2, 5 -> output = -1\\n\\n> 1, 2, 5, 3 -> output = 2.75\\n\\n> 2, 5, 3, 6 -> output = 4\\n\\n> 5, 3, 6, 2 -> output = 4\\n\\n> 3, 6, 2, 7 -> output = 4.5\\n\\n> 6, 2, 7, 1 -> output = 4\\n\\n> 2, 7, 1, 2 -> output = 3\\n\\nAssume a function that takes in input if it exists, otherwise terminates the programme. Maintain a queue and keep pushing the integers received till the queue has size less than k.\\n\\nAlso, maintain a running sum. Once the queue has a size k, output the average i.e sum/k. When we get the next integer, subtract the front element of the queue from the sum and pop it out. Also, add the current integer to the sum and push it into the queue and then output the average.\\n\\nFollow-up: https://leetcode.com/problems/finding-mk-average/\\n\\nOnly the largest were required to be removed. So, it was a bit easier.\\n\\nRound 2 (Technical & Online)\\n\\nBasic introduction. The interviewer graduated from CSE Dept. of IIT Kharagpur, worked as an Analyst in Goldman Sachs and now in Google. He was the most organized of all the interviewers I had. He wrote ‘Interviewer’ and ‘Candidate’ and framed the question very clearly. He even gave the template of the function with the parameters that I had to code. The questions were simple.\\n\\nProblem: He mentioned this as a warm-up problem.\\n\\nGiven n number of blocks on a sidewalk and each block is coloured. The colours can be from 1 to k, where k is also given. The beauty score of a colour c is defined as the length of the longest contiguous blocks of colour c. The king walks on the sidewalk. Given the favourite colour of the king c, find the beauty score of king’s favourite colour.\\n\\nExpected Time Complexity: O(n)\\n\\nExpected Space Complexity: O(1)\\n\\nSolution: Maintain count and answer variables. Increment the count by one if it’s favourite colour. Otherwise take the maximum of answer and count as answer and set count to 0.\\n\\n\\n\\nFollow-up 1: Given q queries, each query has a colour c. Output for each query, the beauty score the colour c.\\n\\nExpected Time Complexity: O(n + q)\\n\\nExpected Space Complexity: O(k)\\n\\nSolution: Create a vector of size k+1 (since the colours start from 1) and initialize the values to 0. Maintain a count variable. Iterate through the array, if the colour is the same as the colour of the previous block, increment the count. Otherwise, take the maximum of the colour’s beauty score till now and the count as the colour’s beauty score and set the count to 1. This is the precomputation.\\n\\nNow, for every query, output the beauty score directly. Therefore, it takes O(1) time for each query.\\n\\nFollow-up 2: Given m operations, where in each operation, the colour of any one block can be changed to any other colour of your choice, and given the king’s favourite colour c, find the maximum beauty score of the king’s favourite colour that is possible using at most m operations.\\n\\nExpected Time Complexity: O(n^2)\\n\\nExpected Space Complexity: O(1)\\n\\nSolution: Two-pointer technique.\\n\\nMaintain two pointers, say i and j. Both are at the beginning of the array. Also, maintain two variables, answer -> the maximum possible so far and operations -> the number of operations left.\\n\\nIterate through the array. If the current block has the colour c, increment only j and otherwise, if operations > 0 then, decrease operations by 1 and increment j by 1 else, keep incrementing i till the operations becomes greater than 0 i.e if the current block at i is not c, then increment operations. Take the maximum of answer and j-i+1 as answer at every step and return the answer.\\n\\nVanga Nikitha\\n\\nTechnical round 1:\\n\\nwas asked for a quick intro.\\n\\na company and it’s employees salaries are stored in trees. For a manager being stored in parent node his reportees are stored in children nodes(given final structure comes out to be tree). A manager is said underpaid if his salary is less than average salary of all his direct and indirect reportees. We have to find total no.of underpaid managers.\\n\\nI was clear with my approach and let him know that then he asked me to wirte psudeo code on the shared google docs I started with how given input is stored but got struck in between so told him I was not so familiar with coding part of trees so he tried to help me whenever I asked some doubt. After coding part was done he modified question a bit that how can we minimise the operations if each operation is to make every underpaid manager as not-underpaid.I told hime the naïve approach and made changes to the code he seemed okay with it but as we were out of time there was no time left to discuss more abt it.\\n\\nTechnical Round 2:\\n\\nbasic intro session\\n\\na question on strings.\\n\\n\\n\\nGiven a string it is said ungrouped if there is exists a letter twice or more and there is other letter between it’s occurences in string.\\n\\nTestcase-“doll”-grouped\\n\\n“dolal”-ungrouped\\n\\nI came up with an approach using maps and explained her with examples she liked the approach and asked to code it on docs.Discussed time and soace space complexities.\\n\\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/search-in-row-wise-and-column-wise-sorted-matrix/\\n\\nI let her know the brute force approach and said her that I would use binary search to optimise it.\\n\\nWas unable to get the totally optimised solution but I optimised by using binary search row wise or column wise. Was not asked to code it but I got to explain my approach on some testcases she provided me. By the time I told her this approach we were out of time so she was like this seems like a good optimisation tho. so she ended the session by asking me if there’s anything I had to ask her.\\n\\nGoogle interveiw questions and experiences 2024\\n\\nLeela Varshini Kodiboyina\\n\\nIntern Offered\\n\\nCoding Round \\n\\nThere were 2 coding questions to be solved in 60 min of time. They were considerably hard. One question was on graphs(dfs) and the other was on dynamic programming.\\n\\nRound 1 (Technical, Online)\\n\\nThe interviewer was friendly, she introduced herself and asked me to give a brief intro of me. Then she asked me to join the doc that was shared beforehand. After I joined, she gave me a question that was: \\n\\nGiven n ranges of the form (Li,Ri), where each range represents a continuous sequence of integers, you are provided with q queries. For each query, determine whether the queried number is contained within any of the given ranges.\\n\\nFirst, I told her the brute force approach, then somewhat optimized approach and finally I told her the Binary search approach. She was satisfied with what I explained to her and asked me to code it (whole code, Google never asks for pseudo codes). \\n\\n\\n\\nWhile I was coding, she asked me to code as to handle a continuous stream of queries, rather than processing all q queries in a single batch at the start. After I had written the code, she asked me to explain my code briefly. \\n\\nShe was convinced and lastly, she asked me to implement the lower bound function that I had used in my code. \\n\\nWith this the interviewer concluded and I asked her some standard questions about the company and the round was done. It went for 45 minutes.\\n\\nRound 2 (Technical, Online)\\n\\nThis was also a Technical round, Google doesn't conduct HR round. This went for 35-40 min. The interviewer introduced himself, asked my intro and asked me to join the shared doc. \\n\\nFirstly, he asked a basic question: How do you find the largest odd number in an array of numbers. Simple question, so I answered immediately. He asked me to code and while coding, we discussed about negative odd numbers. He asked to mention the time and space complexities clearly at the end of the code.\\n\\nThen the follow up: \\n\\nHow do you find the kth largest odd number in an array of numbers? \\n\\nI said I will be using priority queue and explained the approach (using min heap). I said I will constantly maintain the size of priority queue to be k so that time and space complexities are little reduced. He asked me to code it. \\n\\nAt the middle, he said I should be returning 0 if there are no k odd numbers at all in the array. I told that if at the end of pushing all the elements of the array into the priority queue, if the size of the priority queue is less than k, I will return 0. \\n\\nAfter the code was done, he asked to write the time and space complexities.\\n\\nHe moved to the next question.\\n\\nThere is a group chat consisting of U users, we need to output the top k most talkative users in the group. We could use a helper function, parse_log that will take the file path of the group chat and directly output a list of pairs of user and word count of each message in the group chat(if L is length of the group chat, outputs list of L pairs). \\n\\nI told I will be using a priority queue again, but at first, I will use an unordered map to store the total number of words each user has spoken. Again, I maintain the size of priority queue to be k. \\n\\nImmediately, we jumped into coding the question. I used the helper function and coded my approach. He asked me to output the k most talkative users in order along with their total word count. After that he asked the time and space complexities, I told him. He asked to write them in \\n\\n\\n\\nthe doc, including what the variables mean and stand for, the space complexity for each data structure. \\n\\nHe asked if I had any questions, I asked him about his experience at Google, he talked for some time and the interview concluded.\"),\n",

You are required to select an outcome from {HH, HT ,TH ,TT} . The casino then would pick one of the remaining 3 outcomes. The dealer would then toss a coin an infinite number of times. If your outcome comes first then you win $10. Else you have to pay $10. Would you be willing to pay to play the game?\\n\\nNote that the coin is a biased coin with probability of heads as ⅔\\n\\nAns) After some calculation , you can notice that for any particular outcome you select, the casino would be able to select an outcome with better probability than you. Thus, it won't be advisable to play the game.\\n\\nMoreover by an intuitive approach you can directly cancel some outcome pairs.\\n\\nEg : You might never select TT as the probability of HH is clearly better than that.\\n\\nQ- You are given an infinite stack of cards numbered from 1 to 5. You have to create a deck of cards from the stack . The opponent then picks a card at random from your deck and guesses a number from 1 to 5. If the number matches the card chosen you have to give him money (in dollars) equal to the chosen number. What kind of deck should you make to minimize the amount of money you have to give?\\n\\nAns) You can create a deck in which the expected payoff of any number is the same. This is done so that the value of choosing any number is equally minimized.\\n\\nSay there are v cards numbered 1, w cards numbered 2 , x cards numbered 3 , y cards numbered 4 and z cards numbered 5. Then if the payoff of each card is the same,\\n\\n1v=2w=3x=4y=5z\\n\\nOne such answer would be v=60, w=30, x=20, y=15, z=12.\\n\\nFollow-up question:\\n\\nNow for each card you include in the deck, you have to pay the opponent 1 cent before the game. What should be your new deck?\\n\\n\\n\\nAns) In this question, you have to minimize both the number of cards and the expected payoff. I gave the interviewer an expression of the function to be minimized and he was satisfied. He also asked me to approximate the expected answer and I gave him an example with an answer as 0.6 . The actual answer is 0.56.\\n\\nSreehari C\\n\\nRound-1\\n\\nQuestions based on Probability and Game theory\\n\\nSome of the Questions I remember:-\\n\\n1-You and your opponent play a game. You have a deck of cards each having a number from\\n\\n1-5. The Exact Number of each of the cards is unknown.\\n\\nGame 1- The opponent tells u the number of cards of each denomination that is present in the deck. Now you tell your opponent 1 card you want to pick. Then you select one of the cards randomly from the deck. If the card you choose is same as the card you told the opponent earlier, you get reward equal to that of what is written in the card. What is the optimal strategy?\\n\\n My ans- For each card from 1-5 calculate the expected value of reward if you choose that card, for eg let's say you pick 2. Then expected reward=((number of 2)/total cards) *2. Do this for every number from 1-5 and choose the one that maximizes the reward. He quickly moved to game 2 and was satisfied with the answer I gave.\\n\\n Game 2- Now you are the opponent. You get to choose the composition of the deck. What would be the composition you would choose so that your opponent get's the minimum reward?\\n\\nMy ans- We should make all cards indistinguishable from one another, ie the expected reward of choosing one should be the same as 2,3 etc. I \\n\\n\\n\\nthought like if there is a clear winner the opponent will definitely choose that card under optimal strategy. So if the expected reward for each of the cards are same => it doesn't matter which card you choose you end up with the same reward in expectation. So for achieving this 1*n1=2*n2=3*n3=4*n4=5*n5, where ni denotes the number of cards of each denomination.\\n\\nHe then asked how can I prove that it is optimal and asked to give an example deck of this. I replied by saying that it is a kind of Nash equilibrium and no policy dominates over another. 5 3 2 1 1 was the example deck I gave and he was kind of satisfied with it.\\n\\n Game -3 Assume that you have a cost incurred of 1 cent for every card you keep in the deck and you have to give your opponent the money if they get it right. Now how do you play optimally to minimize the loss?\\n\\nMy ans- Assume total cards as x and calculate the expected reward, differentiate wrt x and minimize the loss.\\n\\nHe then told not to go into the maths and told to guess and approximate number.I was unsure and guessed the same composition as before . He said that process is ok but ans is not correct and moved on to next question.\\n\\n2-https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/372638/100-sided-die-probability\\n\\nRound 2\\n\\nThis round only a single question was there.\\n\\nSuppose that you take part in an auction for a box.\\n\\nThe value in the box is decided by :-\\n\\n Toss a coin 200 times, whenever the head comes put 1$ into the box.\\n\\n\\n\\nQ1- What is your strategy if you are playing optimally(2 players, you and your opponent)?\\n\\nMy ans- As expected number of heads is close to 100 , my strategy will be to bid 99.\\n\\nQ2- If you are a person that don't wish to incur loss, ie give more importance to loss than gain,\\n\\nWhat would be your optimal bid?\\n\\nMy ans- By central limit theorem the number of heads follow Normal distribution. So I told it is best to go for mean-2*variance or mean-3*variance. He was satisfied with the above 2 answers and moved on.\\n\\nQ3- Suppose your opponent is a person taken randomly from street. What should be your strategy?\\n\\nMy ans- I told that a random person will not do mathematics this much and told 95-96 would be resonable.He was not satisfied with this and told you should bid around 80-85 only as the general pattern is that they bid around 50.He gave no explanation why this is so.\\n\\nHe then asked if I increase the number of persons I select, What should be the strategy?\\n\\nI told 95-96 again and he told now it makes sense to go in that range as there is a chance that some person would go for bid in that range.\\n\\nNow you are playing against me, what would be your best bid? Again I went with 99 and he was not satisfied with it.\\n\\nNow u r given an option either to tell me a strategy according to which u will play or not.In this case u have to play by the strategy if u tell it and in case of a tie u win. What is ur strategy?\\n\\nI told that I will not reveal first. Then he gave me a hint that u can do it probabilistically ie sometimes 0 and sometimes some other number.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen after a discussion , I told that if we were to go for 0 half of the times and 50 rest half, we would get on an average of 49.5 as opponent always goes for 1 as optimal strategy. He told approach was correct and even though  it is not the exact solution.\\n\\nThen the next q he asked was suppose ur opponent knows the outcome of first 10 tosses, how will ur bidding strategy change? I was blank on this q and was not able to answer\\n\\nJane street interveiw questions and experiences 2022\\n\\nMukul Lakra\\n\\nJane Street Interview\\n\\nHere , initially there are rounds of interviews which are considered as tests but they are one on one interviews but your video is not turned on.\\n\\nThey organized an interview for some in the tests , else a hackerrank test if you are shortlisted and I think the criteria for this is CPI. An interview is better because they don't want you to solve the complete question but just want you give an idea how to approach the question, hence it is difficult to express it in a subjective exam rather than orally and as the interview is more interactive.\\n\\nAfter the tests , there were interviews , some fixed number of interviews for everyone shortlisted and not rounds as such.\\n\\nThe questions asked and the ideas or answers i gave are as such :\\n\\nQ1) Expected value when a dice is rolled once and the person has a chance to roll it again if he wants to and can again roll if he again wants to. So , 1 to 3 rolls are permitted as per choice of the person and the value is the value on dice in the last roll he performed.\\n\\nYou can solve it but there is no need. They just want you to give them an idea. I just told them that as we throw the dice 1st time , E(X) = 3.5 , so , if we get 1,2,3 , we roll again or else settle , so now the new E(X) = ⅙(4)+⅙(5)+⅙(6)+½(3.5) if the person is allowed to perform 2 rolls at max. Similarly , we can approach for 3 rolls.\\n\\nLink to solution :\\n\\nhttps://math.stackexchange.com/questions/179534/the-expected-payoff-of-a-dice-game\\n\\n\\n\\nQ2) We perform a task 50 times. We have 2 boxes and we put a coin randomly in any box until we want but we don’t know which box the coin went into. After some n rolls (user choice) , we can quit putting coins if we want and then for the next 50-n times , each time we choose a box randomly and get all the coins in that box. So , what should be the value of n.\\n\\nI said that I will take n around 40 so that the risk of getting coins in only 1 box out of the 2 is reduced a lot. There is 1/512 probability that we will select only 1 box each of the 10 times remaining and if we get coins in both boxes , we can again continue with putting coins in boxes for the remaining turns.\\n\\nThen he asked me for 1000 turns. I said that I will take n around 970-975. He then asked me that last time you chose to stop at 40 turns , 10 turns before total and here at 970 out of 1000 i.e. 30 turns before , why so ? I answered that this is because of the high risk factor involved in the 2nd case.\\n\\nQ3) Find the maximum among the following has the highest expected value  :\\n\\nSquare of the value on roll of a die (Ans : 15.167)\\n\\nProduct of values on two dice rolls (Ans : 12.25)\\n\\nSquare of Median of the value on two dice rolls (I don’t remember but i think it is also 12.25)\\n\\nAns was 1).\\n\\nQ4) (1 hr discussion , just tell the concept. They told me that if we give you time , you can find the answer easily but we need to see your solution approach on the spot.)\\n\\nThere is a 50 sided dice. It is rolled once and we get a value , and then it is rolled again until we get a 2nd distinct value and so on until we get 4 distinct values.Now , sort these 4 values and variable A is equal to sum of 1st and 4th value in sorted array i.e. sum of min. And max. Value and variable B is the sum of the 2nd and 3rd value in the sorted array. Let us consider , when you roll the dice , you get value ‘a’ on the 1st roll and ‘b’ , ‘c’ and ‘d’ (a,b,c,d need not be in ascending order). To get the maximum value of modulus of A-B , what should be the expected value of ‘a’?\\n\\nHere , in telling the approach , I used the principle of symmetry in probability mentioned in the book 50 challenging problems in probability.\\n\\nHe asked me to tell him what is the principle of symmetry that I am using in the solution approach.\\n\\nThe approach is :\\n\\nThe value is ‘a’. For it to be the biggest among the 4 values , all others must be less than it. So , the probability for that case is approximately (((a-1)/50)^3). Let us consider ‘a’ is 40 . So , the probability for it being the largest is approximately ((39/50)^3). So ,as 1 has to select 3 values for b,c and d between 1 and 40 , so by principle of symmetry , their values are 10,20,30(not respectively). Hence calculate modulus of A-B. Hence for the value of the variable ‘a’ to be x , find the probability for it to be 2nd largest , 3rd largest and smallest and hence find corresponding values of modulus of A-B and you will get it as a function of x and then use differentiation to find the maximum. He asked me to solve it roughly and as far as I remember , I \\n\\n\\n\\ngave him the answer to be about ‘40’. You can solve it using this approach to get a better answer as you have enough time and approach in your hands , hopefully.\\n\\nBasis for questions further on from here : Initially , you have 100 coins that you can spend and you should try to make the maximum out of it and remember that answer after thinking carefully about all the cases as once you invest some coins , you can’t undo it . I mis-calculated the mean in a question and hence got a high loss in a game which may cost you the interview and might have cost me mine. So , be fast and careful in calculations.\\n\\nQ5) Can’t share what exactly was asked as I was asked to fill in an Excel sheet and it was a really innovative question but I will try my best to give you the ideas of what the questions were all about.\\n\\nThis was totally based on stock buying and selling. In this case , there were 3 people. You , one person who buys optimally that is he never buys at a loss and a random buyer/seller buying at a random price. You all have some quantities of stock that you  can buy and sell. We(1st person in bidding) do not know about the actual price of stock but we know that the 2nd person in the bidding is an optimal buyer/seller and the 3rd person is the random buyer/seller. So , when we are selling a stock , we will see whether the optimal buyer has bought it or not , if he has , then we need to increase the selling price. There is a window which is the difference in your selling price and your buying price of a stock . For roll of a dice , the window can be 3,4 where our bidding price is 3 and selling price is 4 as expected value of the dice is 3.5 So , the size of the window is 4-3=1 and in the question we can decide the window size and can change the bidding price or selling price of the stock by at most window size/2 . Here , we need to bid better so that  we can buy stocks and then sell them at higher prices to increase the profit.\\n\\nIn which of the following cases will you bid more aggressively?\\n\\n           When you are up against 1 person or against 100 bidders. I don’t know the answer but I said that I bid more aggressively against 100.\\n\\nQ6) I was given a question in which only 1 of the two given cases will happen and we were told that we lose our applied money if a case does not happen and win another certain amount of money , a fraction of the applied money if that case happens and we were told the probability of both of the events happening and they add up to 1. So , I chose the event with higher expected value of returns as it seems lucrative and fell in the trap but later he asked me, Can you invest some amount of  money in both like x coins in 1st event and y coins in 2nd event so that you never lose money and I got such a case. So , look for all the cases carefully first and then answer.\\n\\nThey used to have dice and other things in hand in the final interview and used to do a practical throwing of dice or picking of cards to determine your win and loss and note it down.\\n\\nThere was a simple card question as well that the probability of which of the following cases is maximum. That was simple enough but I could not figure out what the four cases were.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVatsal Gupta:\\n\\n>1st round:\\n\\n\\tProbability and markets guide\\n\\nReplicate 10-sided dice form 6 sided dice\\n\\n\\tSome questions on a coin toss and expectation values I solved it using GP and nested sub-problem identification.\\n\\n\\tAnother question asked me to design a deck with cards from 1 through 9 infinite type of each to have a minimal loss on guessing the opponent’s guess being right. (product equalization)\\n\\n>2nd round:\\n\\n\\tBox with money ($200 expectation after 400 coin tosses), opponent guesses then I guess…equality I win otherwise higher bet wins the box, optimal play?

He then read about the programming languages I know and then about the key courses taken and then picked the course probability out of those.\\n\\nHe started the interview with JEE-type questions and then slowly shifted on to probability.\\n\\nQ1) (i)^(i) (i=sqrt(-1)) \\n\\nI solved it and answered that it was e^(pi/2)\\n\\nQ2) Which is larger : e^(pi) or pi^(e)\\n\\nHe gave a hint to use the function (lnx/x) and then I proceeded further and solved. The interviewer then just went ahead with another question.\\n\\nQ3) Normal distribution and integration of (x*e^((x^(2))/2)) from -infinity to infinity. He wanted me to solve this using normal probability distribution.\\n\\nI think its answer was (sqrt(2*pi)) , not sure though , then he asked me the way i solved it.\\n\\nQ4) Two random variables: X1,X2 , uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 , probability of X1+X2 < ½\\n\\nAsked me to do it by graph. Ans is 1/8\\n\\nQ5) A 1m rod randomly breaks at two points. Find the probability that the 3 parts will form a triangle. \\n\\nI got 1/8. He said that the answer is ¼ and then we both solved but got ⅛ , then later on we realised that we missed the opposite case and hence, answer would be ¼.\\n\\nQ6) If the probability distribution function of X1,X2,...,Xn is P(Xi<=x)=f(x) , then find \\n\\nP(max(X1,X2,......,Xn)) <= x\\t\\t\\tAns: f(x)^n\\n\\nP(min(X1,X2,......,Xn)) >= x\\t\\t\\tAns: (1-f(x))^n\\n\\nQ7) About class 12th extreme value theorem\\n\\nQ8) There are n students in a class. Find the probability that at least 2 of them have the same birthday. Simple probability question.\\n\\nRound 2 : Puzzles and CP based\\n\\nAsked me about one of my projects and as it was based on python , he asked me about python decorators and the minimax algorithm used in the program.\\n\\n\\n\\nQ1) Two people are playing a game. You start first. One person can pick 1,2 or 3 marbles at a time from a stack of marbles. How will you play the game to have the maximum winning chance?\\n\\nIf the total number of marbles initially is 4n+1 and opponent plays optimally , we are bound to lose , else , we are bound to win if we play optimally.\\n\\nQ2) Tell all the sorting algorithms you know. Just name them. Then asked me to write the pseudo code of merge sort on paper.\\n\\nQ3) How to find out whether a linked list has a loop or not?\\n\\nI told we can use map or we can use two pointer approach where one skips two nodes at a time while other does 1 node at a time . If they get same value sometime , there is a loop.\\n\\nQ4) You have to bet on a game in which a person rolls two dice and get the money equal to their sum and if he wants , he can roll them once again and will get money equal to the new sum but he can roll again once. How much money will you bet on this game(or basically what is the expected value)?\\n\\nIt took a bit of calculation. He misunderstood my solution a lot of times but asked me to tell my approach. If in first try, his sum is less than 7 , then he will go for the 2nd try. Else, he will be satisfied and then I calculated the expected value.\\n\\nRound 3 : HR Round\\n\\nFirst , they asked me to introduce myself. \\n\\nThen , why am I choosing JPMC over other companies ?\\n\\n How do you come to know about JPMC?\\n\\nWill you prefer a maths heavy role or coding heavy role? \\n\\nWhy are you interested in quant? What are the names of the interviewers?\\n\\nSWEEYA REDDY\\n\\nInterview 1 (45 minutes)\\n\\nThe first interview was technical. I introduced myself and told her that my main skills was logical reasoning, problem solving and maths, so the interview proceeded in that direction. The questions were on probability and basic competitive programming. Most of the probability questions can be cracked if you have solved brainstellar and 50 challenging problems on probability. \\n\\nOne of the questions was if there is a stick and you can break it at 2 points so as to divide it into 3 parts, then find the expected length of the shortest, medium and the longest stick.\\nAnother question was if a gun has 2 bullets placed consecutive out of 6, and if the first shot fails, should he roll the barrel again? \\n\\n( https://brainstellar.com/puzzles/probability/1 ).  \\n\\nThey asked me a cp question which I don't remember.\\n\\nAfter that I was given a chance to ask them any questions. I asked her what motivated her to come to work everyday.\\n\\nInterview 2 (45 minutes)\\n\\nThe 2nd interview was a technical round. The interviewer was very friendly. \\n\\nThe first question was: You can roll a dice 3 times, and you will be given as many dollars as your highest roll is. You can choose to stop anytime, then what is the expected payout if you play optimally.\\n\\nThe next question was to implement stack using structures/classes with arrays/linked list. I had to share my screen and code this. I had used arrays with classes.\\n\\nThe next question was the common edit distance question. I was told to code in front of him, and had to run a couple of test cases. My code worked for all the test cases.\\n\\n\\n\\nInterview 3 (45 minutes)\\n\\nMy 3rd interview was also technical.\\n\\nThe first question was how to find the maximum product of 3 elements in an array. This was a greedy approach question. The trick here was to use less space and time, as the complexity would be linear anyways.\\n\\nI was asked another dp question which I don't remember now, and a couple of probability questions. \\n\\nHe then asked me what is the advantage of C++ programming language. Then about OOPS. He asked me to choose 3 of my favourite properties of OOPS and reason why they're my favourite. Differentiate between structures and classes.\\n\\nIn each of the interview try to ask the interviewer some good questions so that they know you're interested. If you have prepared for an SDE role but want to crack quant interviews too, it is usually enough to solve brainstellar \\n\\n( https://brainstellar.com/ ) and 50 challenging problems \\n\\n(https://mbapreponline.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/fifty_challenging_problems_in__2.pdf ). It is a good habit to mention to the interviewer your strengths so that s/he proceeds in that direction.\\n\\n\\n\\nNandini Sharma\\n\\nCoding round:\\n\\nMCQs based on probability, math and coding.\\n\\n2 very easy coding questions.\\n\\nInterview :\\n\\nRound 1:\\n\\nHe asked me to tell about your best project. Then he saw that I had a project on ml in my resume, he started asking me questions about pandas etc. I told him that I would like to be asked about coding . So he switched to coding. I explained my answers on a white sheet using diagrams and codes.\\n\\nFind the middle element of a linked list.\\n\\nFind if a given array can be divided into 2 subsets with equal sum.\\n\\nInfix to prefix conversion using stacks.\\n\\nQuestions from linear algebra. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Real and imaginary solutions.\\n\\nRound 2:\\n\\nHe asked me general questions like- will you allow a machine to handle your money?I said yes, but there is risk. What is the difference between python and c++? I told him that python is interpreted and c++ is compiled. Python is slower , c++ is faster and closer to the system. Does c language have classes? No, we  can implement classes in c lang by using struct .What do you understand by quant finance? Implement stack and queue using arrays Etc.. then he asked if I am good at mathematics..and I said yes🙂.\\n\\nRound 3:\\n\\nHR round. I was asked if I had any questions about the role. I asked what being a quant is like in jpmc. They explained to me the work culture, salary-bonus etc. Then general questions, why did you choose quant over sde. It was more like talking to a mentor.\\n\\nTip: try to be positive. Being serious does not help at all. Even if you don't know the answer, speak something about it.

OA consists of two sections - 30 questions in 35 minutes (12 - probability, 8 - general math, 10 - coding mcqs) and second part consisted of 2 coding questions in 60 minutes. The questions were of difficulty Leetcode medium.\\n\\nThe first round begin with my CV review and he asked me describe my CV in 3 minutes. Then he gave me a question to find the volume of water contained in a hemisphere if we fill it upto height h. I solved it using integration and he pointed at my cv that i had mentioned calculus in key course taken. He then gave me a question on double integration. After this there were discussion on my experience, projects, asking basic ML questions, assumptions of linear regression etc. Then he shifted towards probability, gave me question to find expected payoff on rolling a die according to given conditions. Asked about normal distribution and log-normal distribution. He then asked to find maximum drawdown if i am given the daily stock price in a array, a very easy question. Then he asked about pickling and unpickling in python, didn’t knew it, Then he asked about whether i have implemented deep learning models in my projects from scratch or are they just library implementations. At last he asked about my priority - math or programming and I answered math.\\n\\nThe second round begin with my introduction and again asking about my priority math or programming. This round was focussed on DSA, OOPS, language fundamentals. She asked - Suppose I am a given an array consisting of n+2 elements from 1 to n and two numbers are repeated in the array, Find those numbers. Told my approach first calculate sum and then calculate squared sum so you get two equations, solve them to get two numbers, then written pseudo code for it. Then she said if numbers are not necessarily from 1 to n. Gave O(n) space and O(n) time solution. Then she asked if i can further optimize I said no. Then she asked to optimize space, I answered it can be done O(1) space but time complexity would be O(nlogn) in this case. Then she asked about OOPS polymorphism, abstraction and inheritance and their example. Then she asked about my first language - python or C++. I answered C++, but after that all questions were from python. Started with difference between list and tuple, deep copy and shallow copy, and their equivalent implementation in C++. What are decorators, generators and pickling, unpickling in python (This time answered because I have just read about it in between the rounds), Then she asked whether I had attended JPMC event happened in April in campus and told me to tell any one thing I remembered from session.\\n\\nMy final round (HR round) was very short barely of 2-3 mins. Begin with quick intro from both sides, she saw my CV and responded very quant heavy CV, do you have any questions? Asked two questions she responded and it ended.\\n\\nArush Jain (220101016)\\n\\nIntern Offered\\n\\nThere were 4 rounds, all offline. It ranged from math and probability, DSA, OOPs, puzzles to CV discussion. Also research a bit about the company and the role since many were asked about it even before the HR round.\\n\\nFirst round was mainly math and probability. In the first question, we are given the range of a random variable X from 1 to 10^12. We have to find the probability P((X^3)%100 = 11). I was able to solve it with hints from the interviewer. Basically you need 1 at unit place and 7 at tens place, so the probability is 1/100. Second question was related to Bayes theorem and was easy. In the third question A and B are given two unbiased coins and they toss in turns until one of them gets a head. So I had to find out if we should start first or second to have a higher chance to win. Answer is to start first. Its follow up was that A is given a biased coin instead and then we have to find the probability of heads in the biased coin so that both A and B have the same chances of winning whoever starts first. Simple geometric progression, answer is 1/3. I was also asked some questions on linear regression and also on Black Scholes Model since I did a project on it. At the end he asked if I had some questions to which I asked him some. Overall it was medium hard.\\n\\nSecond round was mainly OOPs and DSA. Started with a simple introduction and some discussion over my project on Options. Then he asked me standard OOPs questions like what are virtual functions, diamond problem, virtual destructor, etc. Then we moved to DSA. In the  first question he asked me to find the minimum steps to reach 100 from 1 on a Snake and Ladders Board if we can control the dice at every step. Make a directed graph from every node and make extra edges for snakes and ladders. In the second question, we are given k trips and n cabs. We are also given time taken by each cab to complete a trip. All the trips are identical and you can use all the cabs parallelly. We have to find the minimum time to complete all the k trips. Use Binary Search over min time (0) and max time (k*min(time taken by each taxi)) and at each time calculate if you can do k trips using all the n cabs parallelly.  At the end he asked if I had some questions to which I asked him some. Overall it was an easy medium.\\n\\nThird round was project discussion and puzzles. Started with my projects. She was interested in my ML project and Option Pricing project which I did since she worked in those departments. We had a discussion over it. She also asked me about my experience as a Research Consultant at WorldQuant. Then we moved to puzzles. First one was to find which pattern from  HTH and HHT has a higher probability of occurrence. Standard probability question. In the second puzzle, we are given a permutation from 1 to n and we randomly select two elements and duplicate them in that permutation. We have to find duplicate numbers in an n+2 size array. This was also easy. At the end she asked if I had some questions to which I asked her some. Overall it was an easy medium.\\n\\nFourth and the last round was the HR round. She asked me standard HR questions like what qualities do you bring with you, why JPMC, etc. Overall very easy.\\n\\nSparsh Mittal\\n\\n2 Technical interviews and 1 HR round\\n\\n\\n\\n1st Technical Interview: (around 30 mins)\\n\\nThe interview was mostly focused on OOPS, and the interviewer was very friendly and chill. He asked me the following questions:\\n\\n3 favourite OOPS concepts, explain them, why favourite and real world use cases.\\n\\nWhat are the ways in which data members of one class can be used by methods of another class? Tell every possible way.\\n\\nComparing those methods told in the previous question and determining the best one.\\n\\nThere were some more questions which I don’t remember\\n\\nSome basic DSA questions were asked:\\n\\no Max product of any 3 numbers in an array. Think of all edge test cases.\\n\\no The maximum value of ai-aj where i>j,\\n\\n2nd Technical Interview: (around 20 mins)\\n\\nThis interview mostly checked my maths skill and probability knowledge. The questions asked were:\\n\\nWhich is greater e^pi or pi^e?\\n\\nHow to proof that any cubic equation will have at least one real root?\\n\\nIf x1 and x2 are random variables then the value of P(min(x1,x2)<x)?\\n\\nFormula for standard deviation, remember to label all the variables.\\n\\nHow to find outliers in a given data?\\n\\nFind (i)^(i)\\n\\nHR Round: (15 mins)\\n\\nHe first introduced himself and then asked me to introduce myself. Then he asked me the following questions:\\n\\nWhy do you want to join JPMC?\\n\\nWhat does JPMC do?\\n\\nHow is JPMC different from GoldMan Sachs?\\n\\nWhat problem does my project solve\\n\\nAditya Mandal \\n\\nRound 1: Based on Coding\\n\\nThe interviewer asked me to give a short intro and then proceeded to go through my resume from top to bottom. He asked me to explain my first project which was a Python-based discord bot. Then he started asking questions :\\n\\nQ1: Differences between list and tuple in Python, Which one takes less memory?\\n\\nAns: I said the list is mutable and, a tuple is immutable. Tuple takes less memory, as the list can be changed therefore there is some extra buffer needed which doesn’t happen in the case of a list.\\n\\nQ2: Differences between MongoDB and MySQL (as I had used MongoDB in my project)\\n\\nAns: MongoDB is NoSQL, which stores data in object format, MySQL stores data in table form and is SQL.\\n\\nHe went on to ask about the difficulties faced in the project and also justify the selection of tech stacks. As my CV was CP-based, He started with some coding questions.\\n\\nQ3: Given a sentence, reverse the word sequence and return the sentence. Write the pseudo-code.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor eg. for input-> “My name is Aditya Mandal” the code should output->” Mandal Aditya is named My”\\n\\nI gave him a simple iterative O(n) soln using a temporary string variable.\\n\\nHe then asked What if there are multiple spaces between the words?\\n\\nI made slight changes in my pseudo code and the interviewer was convinced.\\n\\nQ4: Given a binary search tree and the pointers of two nodes, find the distance between the two nodes.\\n\\nAns: Maintain two pointers, and initialize them to the root pointer. Traverse the pointers similar to how we do when we search for a value in a BST. The pointers go together till a node (LCA) and then separate. When they, separate maintain two counters until the nodes are found. Return the sum of the counters.\\n\\nQ5: How to find the expected value of a CRV and DRV.\\n\\nQ6: Give the expected value of e^X, where X is a normal random variable.\\n\\nHe asked me if I had any questions, and I asked about what language I actually get to work in.\\n\\nRound 2: Based on OOPs/ Coding\\n\\nThis interviewer was pretty chill. He asked me if I was comfortable with OOPs.\\n\\nQ1: Explain any three concepts of oops with an example. I explained abstraction, encapsulation, and inheritance, In Inheritance, I gave an example of a car, where the car can inherit a class of vehicles.\\n\\nQ2: In what ways can you use a function from one class in another class?\\n\\nQ3: He asked a question based on my answer, and asked how would I implement a tyre in my car class?\\n\\nQ4: Gave me two situations :\\n\\na. The car class inherits from a tyre class.\\n\\nb. A tyre object is created inside the car class.\\n\\nWe had a discussion on which one would be better implementation for the tyre class.\\n\\nQ5: Given an array of integers A. Find the maximum value of (Aj - Ai), j != i.\\n\\nIterate over the array, keep the max and min of previous elements, and calculate the maximum of max( (Ai - prevmin), (prevmax - Ai)) for all i.\\n\\nQ6: Time complexity of sorting algorithms? Why is comparison sort bounded by nlogn ?\\n\\nI gave the proof using decision tree.\\n\\nHe asked if I had any questions and then he told about his experiences at JPMC.\\n\\nRound 3: Puzzle/Probability\\n\\nThe interviewer said As I had enough coding questions, this round would be based on puzzles and probability.\\n\\nQ1: Game: HHT of HTH\\n\\nQ2: Explain the central limit theorem. How will you explain this to a five-year-old?\\n\\nQ3: Find the average salary without disclosing the individual's salaries\\n\\nQ4: You are playing a game. There are three boxes with a treasure hidden behind any one of the boxes. You make a move by guessing the box. If there is treasure behind the box you win else the host makes a move and the treasure is swapped to an adjacent box randomly. That is, if the treasure was behind B1, it would move to B2, if it was at B2, it could move to B1 or B3 with equal probability and if the treasure was behind B3, it would move to B2. The treasure will \\n\\n\\n\\ndefinitely move to an adjacent box. What will be your strategy so that you win the treasure in minimum moves?\\n\\nAns: I will keep choosing the middle box (B2). This way I can get the treasure in a maximum of two moves.\\n\\nQ5: Then she asked a modified version of the same question, changing the number of boxes to 5. Find the cat\\n\\nI was able to solve this question with the help of the interviewer’s hints.\\n\\nRound 4: HR Round\\n\\nFirstly, asked me to give a brief intro.\\n\\nHe asked about my PORs. He then told me to explain about two of my projects (not the technicalities but just the impact and scale).\\n\\nWhat do you think JPMC does?\\n\\nWhy are you interested in quant?\\n\\nSanjana Kolisetty\\n\\nRound 1 (Technical & Offline)\\n\\nThe interviewer was chill. He told me to introduce myself. Then, he asked me to explain all my projects. I had 2 ML and 1 Web Dev project. I explained the 2 ML projects. Then, he said that he will first ask some OOPS questions. He told me to pick 3 of my favorite OOPS concepts and define them. He also asked me to tell an example of each. After that, he asked if there is a class of cars, and a class derived from it is Maruti Suzuki. There is another class tyres. So, if Suzuki needs to have the variables of tyres, should it inherit it or create an object of tyres class withing the Suzuki class. There was a long discussion on this and at the end he said, it was an open-ended question. Later he asked two simple dsa problems.\\n\\n1. Given an array, find the maximum product of 3 elements.\\n\\nI said that the naïve solution is three for loops and O(n^3) solution but we can improve it to O(nlogn) by sorting it and taking the maximum of the last 3 and first 2 and last 1.\\n\\nHe then asked me to explain any sorting algorithm which has runtime complexity O(nlogn). I told about merge sort. He then asked me to prove why sorting algorithms have a lower bound of nlogn.\\n\\n2. Given an array, find the max(a[j] – a[i]) such that j > i.\\n\\n\\n\\nI said that the naïve solution is two for loops which gives O(n^2) solution and we can improve it to O(n) using dynamic programming.\\n\\nThen, he asked me about Linear Regression and Gradient Descent. He asked on what kind of data, applying linear regression is not useful and went on to explain it.\\n\\nRound 2 (Technical & Offline)\\n\\nHe looked at my resume and picked LSTMs. He asked me the different gates in LSTMs – forget, input and output, the purpose of each gate. Later, he asked me about CNNs. As I kept answering, he kept asking. He asked me about the hyperparameter tuning that I have done in my ML projects, word embeddings, a simple example and he told me to explain word2vec. Basically, he asked me a lot about ML and the internal working and implementation. Most of it was from my projects.\\n\\nThen asked me to implement operator overloading on my choice of an operator. I was told to write the code on the black board. After I was done, he asked me to write the same thing in python. I told him I’m not confident about it.\\n\\nHe then moved to ask some basic math questions.\\n\\n1. What is i^i – e^(-pi/2)\\n\\n2. Prove that every cubic polynomial has at least one root – using limits\\n\\n3. Give an algorithm to find the value of roots like value of square root of 2\\n\\nI was initially confused but later I said that it can be done using binary search.\\n\\nThen he asked some probability questions.\\n\\n1. He asked me to calculate the expectation of x such that x >= 0 where x follow normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1. I just told him the integral, he didn’t want me to calculate.\\n\\n2. Given F(x) = P(X<=x) basically the CDF and X1, X2 iids with this CDF.\\n\\na. Y = min(X1,X2), find the CDF of Y.\\n\\nb. Y = max(X1,X2), find the CDF of Y.\\n\\nUsing transformations i.e CDF of Y = P(Y<=y) = P(min(X1,X2)<=y) and similarly the other.\\n\\nRound 3 (HR & Offline)\\n\\nHe introduced himself and asked me to do so. He then asked me to explain me any one of my projects in layman terms. Then he went on to ask me where I’m from. After I said, I’m from Hyderabad, he asked me why I didn’t join IIT Hyderabad. I told him that the cutoffs are higher than that of IIT Guwahati’s. He asked me why I wanted to join JPMC. He then asked me about my school and junior college. It turned out that he is from Hyderabad and lives near my place.\\n\\nAasneh Prasad\\n\\nCoding Round :\\n\\nThis round had 2 sections majorly - 1hr total for both.\\n\\nFirst was maths heavy and CS core. This included mcqs on calculus, Probability, Puzzles and CS core such as Data Structures, Algorithms, DBMS.\\n\\nSecond had 2 coding questions: Q1) https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/cousins-in-binary-tree/\\n\\nPretty much the same problem just one difference was that we had to sum the cousins instead.\\n\\nQ2) Given a digit k and a N sized array of integers. Find the integer in the array having maximum occurrence of k in it.\\n\\nConstraints: N<=1e5, 0<=k<=9.\\n\\nEg) [122,211,344,555] and k=2. Ans=122 as 122 has twice occurrence of ‘2’.\\n\\nInterview Round 1 (Technical & Offline):\\n\\nThis interview started off with some basic introduction. I had done ML projects so he started off with some basics on those. He asked me about linear regression and gave me a plotting and asked me to draw the predicted straight line. I had done a project on LSTM so he asked me to explain what LSTM means in simple words. I just simply said if I have a sentence for eg) Aasneh is from India, he loves to eat Samosa. To establish this connection between India and Samosa We need LSTM. LSTM in layman term is a way to connect our past outputs to our current output and how they influence them. He seemed satisfied with it. If you are using LSTM in your projects be prepared about its gates and architecture and what it actually does. Quant Interviewers love LSTM as its used a lot in industry he said. He then asked me about ‘pass by reference’ and ‘pass by value’ difference. He asked me a bit about polymorphism in OOPS. Make sure to learn OOPS properly. Then he asked me two CP/DSA questions:\\n\\nQ1)Given a N sized Array, find the maximum product of 3 integers in the array.\\n\\nApproach: I just said simply sort the array in ascending order and then take the product of last 3 numbers (largest 3 numbers) or take first 2 and the last one (in case we have negative numbers). This approach will take O(N*log(N)). Q2) https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stocks-i/\\n\\nApproach: I gave him a max suffix array approach whose Time complexity was O(N).\\n\\nYou are given 10 bags. Each bag contains 10 candies. 9 of the bags contains candies of weight 9 grams and one bag contains candies of weight 11 grams. You are allowed to take any number of candies from any of the bags and weigh it. You are allowed to do this operation only once. Find the bag which contains the candies with weight 11 grams.\\n\\nApproach: This required some maths as far as I remember. I needed a hint for this. We basically need to take 1 from bag1, 2 from bag2, …..Just some maths and you will be able to figure out which one contained the 11 gram candies.\\n\\nThere were some basic, easy questions on Probability also.\\n\\nInterview Round 2 (Technical & Offline):\\n\\n\\n\\nThis was relatively shorter interview about 30 minutes or so. We started off with some basic introduction. I had done ML projects so he started off with some basics on those. I had done a project on LSTM so he asked me to explain what LSTM means in simple words. I just simply said if I have a sentence for eg) Aasneh is from India, he loves to eat Samosa. To establish this connection between India and Samosa We need LSTM. LSTM in layman term is a way to connect our past outputs to our current output and how they influence them. We talked about the different gates present in it. The activation functions etc. He also asked me a bit about CNN architecture what are filters, kernel size, dropout etc.\\n\\nHe then started with maths and Probability :\\n\\nWhat ii ?\\n\\nGiven a cubic polynomial prove that it has atleast one root. Hint : Use values at +inf and -inf.\\n\\nGiven a number find it’s square root. I asked me since square root can be irrational we will need a specific precision limit for the answer to converge. We talked a bit about convergence and then I proposed a Binary Search Solution for the problem.\\n\\nGiven two iid X1 and X2 with same CDF Fx Find:\\n\\no Find CDF of min(X1,X2)\\n\\nSolution: Fx2.\\n\\no Find CDF of max(X1,X2)\\n\\nSolution: 1-(1-Fx)2.\\n\\nInterview Round 3 (HR & Offline):\\n\\nI had to talk a bit about my projects and general HR questions and what JPMC does and it’s principles etc.\\n\\nSahil Mehul Danayak\\n\\nQ) Find roots of an equation using Newton-Raphson method.\\n\\nQ) What is the bisection method?\\n\\nQ) Define a positive semi-definite matrix.\\n\\nQ) Prove that the eigen values of correlation matrix of an hamiltonian matrix are real.\\n\\nQ) If X1 and X2 are i.i.d.'s belonging to F (a random CDF) , find CDF of min(X1,X2) and max(X1,X2).\\n\\nQ) Find i^i.\\n\\nQ) What is a perceptron?\\n\\nQ) Name any 3 methods for preventing overfitting in ml or dl.\\n\\nQ) When is lasso regression preferred over Ridge and vice versa?\\n\\nQ) If I use a custom regression method which calculates the absolute difference of actual value and predicted value and then raise each term to power 1/p , p>1, what are the changes in regression? Q) Egg dropping problem https://medium.com/@khopsickle/2-eggs-and-100-floors-a032beb77aaa\\n\\nQ) Diamond problem https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_inheritance\\n\\nSreehari C\\n\\nRound 1- \\n\\nEasy round, basic questions asked. First the Interviewer discussed my projects on ML, and asked a few questions in ML. Some of which I remember are:-\\n\\n\\n\\nConditions for using Linear regression ( linear dependency, no correlation, error term normally distributed), Regularization (L1 and L2) differences between the two, which can be used for feature selection, LSTM( I had a project on stochastic LSTM) , different types of gates in LSTM, why LSTM over simple RNN etc.\\n\\nAfter that some basic CP questions, like:-\\n\\n\\tMax(A[i]-A[j]) in array such that i>j, find max product of any 3 elements in an array etc\\n\\nAfter that one basic maths question he asked, find the trailing number of zeros at the end of n!\\n\\nOverall Easy round, Interviewer was very  chill.\\n\\nRound 2-\\n\\nOpposite of round 1, Maths heavy round. Started with intro and discussing about ML projects. Asked me the maths behind Linear regression, how errors are computed in vectorized way, normal equation, how it is derived using matrix differentiation( does not asked to prove when I told that I am not confident with Matrix differentiation), why (X^T*X) is always invertible in normal equation, why this approach is not used even though it gives exact solution, what happens if correlated features are used in Linear regression etc. After that he went onto my project in Stochastic LSTM and asked about the details of it. Then he asked in details about LSTM many of which I am not aware of. Some of the questions I remember are:- Number of gates in LSTM, How errors are calculated in LSTM, how backword prop works in LSTM etc.\\n\\nAfter that he started with maths questions, \\n\\nWhat is i^i?\\n\\nWhat is integral -infinity to infinity e^-x^2 dx? Aksed me to solve in both ways using double integration in polar coordinates and using cdf of normal distribution.\\n\\nIn key courses I had written probability theory and random process, so asked about it like Markov chain, definition of it, stationery distribution, limiting distribution, difference between stochastic process and Markov chain, poisson distribution, Interarrival times in poisson distribution, real like examples of poisson process etc.\\n\\nFinally he asked me wheather I am aware of numerical methods in finding roots like Newton Ralphson’s method or bisection method. I told I know the basics and had a discussion on it too.\\n\\nHe also asked a bit of linear algebra like eigen value, eigen vectors, SVD etc.\\n\\nOverall maths heavy round, no coding questions where asked.\\n\\nRound 3 – HR\\n\\nAsked why I wanted to join JPMC, where I see myself  in future  etc, Overall Chill round, had a  discussion on my CV . Asked which role I prefer maths heavy or coding heavy, what JPMC does etc.\\n\\nRemarks:- Before attending any HR round have a basic understanding of the role and company you are applying for.\\n\\nAdittya Gupta\\n\\nChillest interview among all the interviews that I gave. Around 15-20 people gave the HR round(last round of the interviews) but they rejected many people among these for unknown reasons. So even if your interview went bang on and you were able to give the last round don’t \\n\\n\\n\\nbe assured that you have secured an intern here. Both the technical interviews were of around 40-45 min each. HR lasted for not more than 15 min.\\n\\nRound 1\\n\\nThe interview began with brief intro from both sides. After this they asked me to explain a little bit more about my projects. I made a project which used C++ as its backend. They asked me questions based on what challenges I would face if I implement the same backend in python instead. I gave 2-3 reasons related to more memory control and speed optimisations that c++ allow me to do in comparison to python. But I feel like they were more interested in python than c++. They were not happy when I told them that c++ is my primary programming language. Most of my interview went in python vs c++ only with them rejecting all my arguments on why c++ is better than python. I feel like they would have been more interested in me if I said I love python and had a ML/AI background. Although I was forwarded to the next round after it.\\n\\nRound 2\\n\\nAlthough better than the first round, this round was too focused on my CV and projects. It felt like most of the questions were repetitive and the interviewer also seemed to be uninterested in my answers as he had no follow-up questions. I wonder if he was even listening to me. Anyways, in the later part of the interview the interviewer asked if I knew about DBMS, OOPS and Computer Architecture. In DBMS and Computer Architecture he told me to explain anything or any topic that I want 😭. In OOPS he asked me about inheritance which I answered and the interview concluded\\n\\nRound 3 (HR)\\n\\nVery basic HR questions. Like what does the company do? What are your expectations ? Where do you see yourself in 5-10 years if you later join us as a full time ? Are you a team person etc.\\n\\nThis lasted for not more than 15 min and the HR concluded it.\\n\\nI don’t know the results because I got a company which was above this in my preference list but I would say they give a huge preference to CPI too and it was seen in their shortlisting procedure.\\n\\nBussa Sai Santhosh\\n\\nRound 1:\\n\\nFirst, I introduced about myself and then he asked me to share screen and write code in vscode, the question is to reverse the number and then he asked me to reverse decimal number and\\n\\ncode it and then he asked some networks questions and I said that I am currently unaware this is in current semester he said ok and then he asked one puzzle https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-8- balls-problem/ and asked some basic questions on SQL and OOPs\\n\\nRound 2:\\n\\nFirst, He asked me introduce myself and asked basic definitions like what is datastructure what is SQL what is artificial intelligence and he was expecting very long answers for these including types and importance and then project discussion and related questions were asked for 20-25 mins and then he asked about my second project for 10 mins and he asked diﬀ b/w linked list \\n\\n\\n\\nand array and advantages and disadvantages of each and asked about vector in c++ how it takes advantages of both linkedlist and array and physical applications of linked lists and asked about diﬀerent types of inner and outer joins in DBMS and ER model’s importance and asked me to define primary and foreign key and some hr like questions were asked like what’s ur father’s occupation what is your life time goal and asked about my +2 college and how many hours I study in my college and asked what is the difficult time in your life and asked what are your strengths and weaknesses\\n\\nRound 3:\\n\\nShe is very busy with her work and she want to complete interview as fast as possible I started with my intro and she cut me in between only and asked some standard questions like why JPMC and what do u know about JPMC like such and finished the interview it was for <10 mins only\\n\\nAasneh Prasad\\n\\nCoding Round :\\n\\n2 questions were asked for 1 hour time limit:\\n\\nQ1) Given a sentence find the maximum even length word in it. If there exists multiple such words return the first occurring one from left. If no such word exists return an empty string. Words in a sentence are separated by “ “ (single space) and terminated by ‘ . ’\\n\\nConstraints : Size of sentence <=1e5.\\n\\nSolution : Maintain your ans string (initialized as empty string) and iterate through the sentence and every time you encounter a word just check if it’s length is even and it’s length is > ans.length() and update ans accordingly.\\n\\nQ2)Given a N sized array of integers, U can perform atmost k operations such that in each operation you can remove an element from the array. Find the minimum number of distinct numbers left in array after applying k such operations.\\n\\nConstraints : N <=1e5 and 0<=k<=N.\\n\\nSolution : Maintain a new array consisting of frequencies of distinct occurring elements and sort it in ascending order. Now you will want to greedily remove the elements starting with the least frequency and go on till you have no more operations left.\\n\\nInterview Round 1 (Technical & Online):\\n\\nStarted off with some basic introduction. Had 2 interviewers in this one. Some basic talk on sorting algorithms. We talked about bubble sort, insertion sort, Merge sort, Quick sort etc. He asked me to write the pseudo code of Merge Sort and derive it’s Time Complexity. Then he gave me a CP problem:\\n\\nGiven N people with height from 5-6 feet. Output them in sorted order. Note the height can be up to single decimal place.\\n\\nMy approach: First I told him about using sorting and simply just outputting the heights. He asked me to solve it without using the sort function. Then I thought of somewhat a frequency array eg) freq[(hi-5)x10] will denote the frequency of height of height hi which has particular unique decimal number after the point. This array will be of size 11. Hence to calculate the frequencies I will just traverse through the height array O(N) and outputting will take O(N+11) so effectively O(max(N,11)). He didn’t quite understand the approach I had to explain him 2-3 times then he was satisfied with it. He then said what if the heights were up to 3 decimal places. I \\n\\n\\n\\nexplained him the same approach would work but Time complexity would be O(max(N,1001)). I explained him how and he was happy with it. The second interviewer was more focussed on my CV. She asked me to brief my 2 ML projects. She seemed more interested in my Dev one. She asked me some basics of API calls and\\n\\nwhat model I was using and it’s parameters. She wanted to go into Deep JavaScript but I told her I hadn’t done much of Dev ☹ and she seemed fine with it.\\n\\nInterview Round 2 (Technical & Online):\\n\\nThis was a full DSA/CP round. We started off with some introduction. Since my CV was focussed on CP he said he would test me only on my problem solving skills.\\n\\nFirst he started with some basic math question.\\n\\nY=2x2-13x+15.\\n\\nx-y+3=0.\\n\\nHe told me to get the solution in two different ways. I told him first we can just solve the two equations for x and y and get the answers. Then I told him first equation is that of a parabola and the second one is of a straight line. I then plotted and showed him the solutions. He seemed fine with it. Then he asked me some question similar to https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/lru-cache/ .\\n\\nHe then asked me a question on anagrams. I don’t remember exactly but it was something like I was given a dictionary of words and I had to generate all 6 letter anagrams and see if they exist or not. He just wanted the brute force solution. When I was coding it up he cut stopped in the middle as we were short of time and wanted to ask me some more things.\\n\\nHe asked me to talk about a problem that I had solved lately. I told him about this https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1846/G. Solution for this is https://codeforces.com/contest/1846/submission/212738339. I had used Dijkstra to solve this we talked about that for a while and other shortest path algorithms. He then asked me if I could solve it in another way. I said maybe there exists a DP solution. We then talked a little about DP and where and when it’s used. It’s features etc.\\n\\nInterview Round 3 (HR & Online):\\n\\nThis round lasted for around 15 minutes only. She asked me to ask her 3 questions. I did asked her some standard questions and discussed about it for a while.\\n\\nKshitij Maurya\\n\\nROUND 1\\n\\nThis round started with a discussion on my resume and we had a long talk on one of the projects I had done.\\n\\nROUND 2\\n\\nThe interviewer asked basic questions on stack, queue etc and other cs fundamentals, he asked about the courses I had taken and what I had studied in them. He then asked some general questions about my college life.\\n\\nROUND 3\\n\\nThis was an HR round. The HR just asked how my day was and was I willing to join their company.\\n\\n\\n\\nSahil Mehul Danayak\\n\\nQ) What are the react component lifecycle methods?\\n\\nQ) Code up a react component using class and other using props.\\n\\nQ) What are the advantages of React over Angular?\\n\\nQ) Is React a framework or library?\\n\\nQ) What are the differences between sql and nosql?\\n\\nQ) Which method stores data in compact form in terms of size Mysql or MongoDb?\\n\\nQ) What do you mean by normalization and give some practical uses of it?\\n\\nQ) What is polymorphism?

I gave an example of having a top navigation bar and side menu bar as being present\\u202f in every page we navigate to on many sites.\\u202f \\n\\nSince you use React , are you aware of any performance issues with it ? \\n\\nI said that I knew that React has some performance issues related to the Create-React-App tool which leads to performance degradation and is actually not used in production environments. \\n\\nDo you know how you can solve the issue?\\u202f \\n\\nI answered that we should write React code from scratch to avoid using the CRA tool. \\n\\nDo you know about the concept of Re-Rendering in React ? \\n\\nI said that React manages its component by having something called the state of a component, and what React does is, whenever a state change happens in components it fully re-renders the components i.e again load everything in the component.\\u202f \\n\\n How can you make re-rendering not be performance degrading ? \\n\\nI said that we should make smaller components. \\n\\n He also asked me about some backend, but that discussion quickly turned towards databases as I expressed an interest in them. \\n\\nI also mentioned that I have less experience with Non Relational Databases as compared to Relational databases. \\n\\n Then he asked another series of questions: \\n\\nHe first asked what are the disadvantages of Relational databases. \\n\\nI said that you need to denormalize data very often as computing joins is extremely costly and performance can be impacted if many such queries are to be evaluated. Also I mentioned that Hierarchies are not natural to be stored in such databases. \\n\\nHe then asked what to do if I need to store a Hierarchy in such a database. To this I replied then you need to maintain a new relation with information about the hierarchy stored in it. \\n\\nThen he changed focus from RDBMS to SQL Queries. \\n\\nDo you know about how SQL Queries are processed? \\n\\nI knew the process but actually was slightly unable to express myself. I fumbled that first the query needs to be parsed and then tokenized for getting the relevant relations and expressions. Then I said that it is also optimized if any optimization can be applied to form representation of Relational algebra-like expressions. Although I was unclear, it seemed to me that he understood that I know the overall process. \\n\\nHe then asked about Query optimization , how is it actually done ? \\n\\nTo this question I didn’t know the exact algorithm(s) but instead tried to explain it by giving an example that the order of projection and selection matters and if it happens such that their order is irrelevant to the final result (i.e the Interpreter/Compiler can determine so), their order of actual evaluation might improve performance. I said that if we consider a selection on only one Column of a relation then we might actually project first and cut down on memory requirement, to actually store only the column values instead of whole tuples from the relation and then check values for the selection expression. \\n\\nAfter this he asked some question (I don’t remember exactly) about Data Structures used in Databases. To this I said that B or B+ Trees were used for index construction in Databases. \\n\\n\\n\\nHe wanted to ask for B+ Tree Data structure in detail but when I said that they are just generalization of Binary Search Trees he didn’t ask further on the full algorithms on the structure. He instead again turned his focus on Performance , asking how are they beneficial?\\u202f \\n\\nI said that they allow fast access times to search for tuples in databases. I gave a realistic example that if we consider a B+ Tree with parameter 100 then in 4-5 levels of the tree, a database with a few millions of records can be managed. \\n\\nTo this he started a series of questions. \\n\\nHe clarified that this is a real problem before posing his question. He said let’s suppose you have a database with 10 lakhs or 1 crore records of person with or without primary key but the primary key is not on their names (he clarifies later that actually he does have a sort of unique identification key for each tuple but he has a different requirement) then how can you ensure fast access to names of the records.\\u202f \\n\\nI immediately said that B+ Trees are meant for such situations. \\n\\nHe then added extra information on the problem. He said that generally what happens is that a Database is not constructed alone, it is constructed along with a UI, for example in our database we can have a search feature to search for names. Now suppose, people type in names to search for the name, but since humans are typing it is very well possible that they make intentional or unintentional errors. To this, I asked for a clarification. He said for example that you can consider cultural differences to be causing the error. He said that considering the fact that in North India you would write names with ‘t’ in it. But the same name in South India may be modified to have ‘th’ in it instead of ‘t’. Now if a person of different culture is remembering a name he might actually misspell it while doing work with it. \\n\\nNow he asked how to handle these things, i.e to still correctly output tuples in spite of errors in input.\\u202f \\n\\nI started out by saying a few assumptions:\\u202f \\n\\nAssume that only 26 latin alphabets are used , i.e I am excluding the cases where you have characters like ö ,etc. These can be handled later on. \\n\\nI assume the spelling error is not too drastic like in the example. \\n\\n\\u202f\\u202f\\u202f\\u202f\\u202f\\u202f\\u202f\\u202f\\u202f\\u202f\\u202f\\u202f\\u202f\\u202f\\u202f\\u202f\\u202f\\u202f\\u202fThen my initial solution was to just search neighboring keys in the Index tree. He said that the misspell might be in the initial few characters and you might be searching a lot of unnecessary nodes and values.\\u202f \\n\\nHe hinted towards using a data structure also. \\n\\n\\n\\nI modified my approach to using a nested Hash table like structure ,for which I used my assumption 1. He said that would be fine but can you think of something else. I then again modified my answer by saying that we can maybe use a Algorithm for it. I suggested using the Edit Distance (Levenshtein Distance) calculation, he then asked for my measure , so I suggested that the metric for it should be the number of modified characters to transform from string a to string b,and then I will fix a number as a parameter which will help me decide to include a particular string, if its Edit distance is less than that of the parameter, in output or not ,But then he commented that you have to consider that the database has huge amount of records and although your approach is correct ,it will lead to performance hit, as you need to calculate the edit distance for every string with the input string. Then I suggested using some partitioning approach like in Binary search but generalized to include this , but he stopped me there and the first round of interview ended for me. \\n\\n(I think he wanted to know about Tries, which didn’t click to me as being similar to nested hash tables. Also I realized later that indeed the Edit distance is not efficient due to the time complexity being O(mn) and you would also have a huge constant associated primarily due to size of database. )\\u202f\\u202f \\n\\nInterview Round 2 :\\u202f \\n\\nThis interview was shorter than the first. Like the first interviewer he also had my CV opened and was going through it. \\n\\nThis interviewer was more focused on my Projects. He saw that I used Express and Node as backend, so he asked about the difference between those two . I said that Express is built on top of Node and it introduces some new concepts like middlewares and routing, so he asked if I have used those features in my project, and I replied in affirmative.\\u202f \\n\\nSince I had used Firebase , he asked what is it. I replied that it is a collection of services. For my first project , I had used Firebase Cloud storage and he asked why did you choose this Non-Relational Database. I replied that I think Cloud storage is not NoSQL but its just a file storage system like in our PCs. He asked why did you choose that instead of Other choices. I said that my project involved lot of Video and Audio files and their conversions, and the process and the files are very heavy to upload/download to/from DB, so I thought that since I am using Firebase Authentication service as well , why not reduce the access time involved, since anyway the time to transfer will be incurred, and it will be a dominating factor because multimedia files are large objects. Then I proceeded to tell the Architecture of the project, that my project involved storing the files in the database simultaneously while processing is done. \\n\\nHe then asked me about my second project. I had used a NoSQL DB in it and he asked why did you use this here and not SQL DB. I replied that generally text messages are not too long and hence their access times may be slightly more and I chose it because of the ability to store hierarchies in a natural way. I had opted to choose hierarchies because my application being a text-message application would be more naturally stored in it. He asked a few questions again \\n\\n\\n\\nabout Firebase and also about Socket.io, and he intended to know about this project's architecture. I said that ,since again I was using Authentication, I had unique IDs generated and since Socket.io uses concept of events being emitted and listened I made a unique event listener and emitter for each of the user , so that I don’t have to actually route messages but actually just broadcast the message and have only the intended person receive the message. \\n\\nAfter this he remarked on my achievement of Department change, to which he asked was your previous branch (ECE) not good enough. I said that I liked Computer Science and Mathematics so I changed. He then changed the topic to my Courses and asked about some basic Computer architecture like pipelining and memory hierarchy in computer system and their trade-offs, he also asked about Linear Algebra and statistics(in Minor) , so do you know about Regression , I said I am aware of the names of few of them like Linear and Logistic Regression but I know about Linear Regression. He asked me to describe it. I described that when we want to predict using a linear model about the dependence of variables on each other ,then we try to minimize errors between the prediction and real data . Since I was not very clear while speaking this ,he asked me to stop, and my second round was over. \\n\\nInterview Round 3 :\\u202f \\n\\nThis was the HR Round. This was really short, the interviewer asked mainly questions about my strengths, weaknesses, hobbies etc and she asked why do you think you can fit in the role. She also asked if I have any problem with relocation. I answered the questions as I felt was appropriate. \\n\\nNitish Kumar\\n\\nCoding round :\\n\\n2 easy questions\\n\\nVenue: Offline\\n\\nMost of the students did both the questions, but shortlisting was done based on cpi, only those\\n\\nstudents who did both the questions and had a cpi greater than 9 were shortlisted and the\\n\\nstudents whose cpi < 9 but greater than 8.9 were waitlisted.\\n\\nInterview:\\n\\nMode: Online\\n\\nRound 1 (Technical round):\\n\\nTwo interviewers the questions were largely based on oops and dbms almost no dsa for me.\\n\\nOne interviewer asked Oops, the questions were medium - hard difficulty, they even asked the\\n\\nimplementation of each oops concepts in notepad.\\n\\nThe other interviewer asked me about my projects and linked them to dbms and asked a few\\n\\ndbms questions and even told me to write a sql query(based on window functions) in the\\n\\nnotepad.\\n\\n\\n\\nDuration: 75 minutes\\n\\nThere is a wait duration of around 2 hrs, must wait in a zoom waiting room.\\n\\nRound 2 (HR + Technical round):\\n\\nOnly one interviewer, this interview was relatively easy. He started with asking me about myself\\n\\nand my projects and then he started asking questions like what is cloud computing, caching,\\n\\nACID properties, transactions, concurrency etc. He even asked about their advantages and\\n\\ndisadvantages.\\n\\nDuration: 30 minutes\\n\\nThere is a wait duration of around 3 hrs, must wait in a zoom waiting room.\\n\\nRound 3 (HR round):\\n\\nOnly one interviewer, this interview was very short. Asked basic hr questions like introduce\\n\\nyourself, why this company, what are your strengths and weaknesses\\n\\nand then she asked me about my location preferences.\\n\\nDuration: 10 minutes\\n\\nSreehari C\\n\\nRound 1:-\\n\\n\\tAsked basic CP qn like reverse a linked list, and a puzzle :- https://bhavinionline.com/2016/12/logical-riddle-will-pay-hotel-owner-daily/\\n\\nChill round , was over quickly.\\n\\nRound 2:-\\n\\n\\tAfter my intro, started asking dev related things like API, cloud computing etc. I had not done a single thing in dev nor my resume contains anything related to dev, then also he was focussing on API, frontend, backend etc of which I didn’t have any idea.

Some questions I remember are:-\\n\\nDifferent types of memory allocation in C++, memory layout (stack, heap, data-segment, code-segment). Suppose a class is there and we have to find out how many objects of the class are created; how would you proceed? \\n\\nAns:- Create a static/global variable and increment it inside the constructor of the class. Asked to explain difference between static and global, where in memory layout they are stored (BSS section), why variables in this section are initialized to 0 and other variables like stack are not? How static variable works etc.\\n\\nNow suppose you only had to find the number of times the class variable is created in heap; how would u proceed?\\n\\n\\tFirst I struggled with the approach then he gave me the hint and asked me difference between new and malloc, I started by saying that new is an operator while malloc is a function , he told that is the hint, that new is an operator. Then I got the approach and told that I would overload new in the class and whenever it is called it calls the actual new function and increments the count as well.\\n\\nThen he asked about theoretical questions like virtual functions, runtime polymorphism vs compile time, templates(implementation as well)  etc\\n\\nHe the asked about memory hierarchy of a computer (register, cache, DRAM, hard disk etc) , why cache is used all.\\n\\nRemarks:- no CP/ dsa question was asked , purely on OOPS and COA.\\n\\nRound 2- Similar to round 1. Started with cache , replacement algorithms – I even added that PLRU method , which is not common and the interviewer was impressed with that. Question related to number of cache misses in the following code if block size is 4:-\\n\\nfor(int i=0;i<100;i++){\\n\\nint c=a[i];\\n\\n}\\n\\nAns-25\\n\\nHe then asked about cache snooping protocols when there are many caches and asked to explain them the same by sharing my screen and giving examples. Lastly he also asked about different types of caches in terms of associativity like fully associative , set associative and direct mapped.\\n\\nAsked whether I am aware of parallel programming, I told no then interviewer explained to me what it is and aksed a qn:-\\n\\n Given an image(1024*1024) , you want to process it and find the number of connected regions. That is assume that the image is made up of 4 colors. Now a cell can be connected to a cell having a common side with it iff they have the same color. \\n\\nHow would you solve it for a single processor? Dfs and from cell (i,j), you go to any of it’s neighbour only if they have the same color and it is not visited. Ans is number of times you do dfs to visit the entire grid.\\n\\nNow assume that you have infinite processors, how many you would use in optimal case?\\n\\nAssume we divide into blocks of k row wise, then time will be\\n\\n(1024/k)*solve(k)+ Merge(k-1), then search for optimal k.\\n\\nRound 3- HR\\n\\nSome Standard HR questions like where do you see yourself in future, why KLA, why this role, then we  had a good discussion on my Project Verilog, Memory  Cache Implementation, asked about Miss status access register (MSHR) and all.

I answered that I align myself with their values quite a lot. The interviewer was going through my resume all through this. Then I was asked to explain about my role as mentioned in the POR section, he asked me what was my role, any challenging situation faced. He clarified that the TPM role does not involve a lot of traditional problem solving and coding per se, so would you still be interested in pursuing this role. \\n\\nThen he gave a situation where you are a consultant, and a company comes to you asking how to go about scaling up, as their current data centers are not meeting the needs. I answered that we can analyze the data to figure out what data is more queried and store that on a more sophisticated database. He gave a hint about using cloud services as they handle a lot of stuff on their end and scalability is very easy there.\\n\\nHe then asked me about my hobbies and briefly about my projects, without going into technicalities. Questions like what was the motivation behind the project, why make this project if better alternatives already exist in market, etc.\\n\\nFinally he asked another situation based question, where Microsoft wants to announce that Windows is 20% ‘better’ than its alternative OSs, in about 6 months’ time. How would you improve windows to be able to substantiate this claim. I answered that we can improve windows’ interaction with the hardware, for certain machines and chips, that would improve the performance. He asked me to focus more on customer empathy, and \\n\\n\\n\\nfigure out various user segments. So I talked about how developers prefer Linux over windows, so we can try making Windows more dev friendly.\\n\\nThe interviewer was quite friendly and gave time to think about solutions to the questions, and also asked me if I had any questions at the end, about the role. 5 people were shortlisted for interview 2.\\n\\nInterview 2\\n\\nA senior PM of the company took this interview. Asked for a brief intro, then asked about my favorite app. I answered Instagram. Then asked what would be a single feature that you would want to implement on Insta. No mention about what user segments to appeal to, what pain points to focus on - it was all open-ended and up to you. \\n\\nFirst I thought about a group chat idea, but after some discussion he pointed out that that is already quite well developed on Whatsapp and Facebook, so wouldn’t be worth it to bring it out on Instagram as well. So I thought about what is unique about Instagram, and I realized it was the interaction between ordinary people and celebrities/influencers. So my idea was to design some kind of a fan club, where users who pay a certain amount to a charity that the celeb endorses, can become a member of this club and ask questions to the celeb.\\n\\nIt was quite a long discussion, about various details of the feature, challenges that you think we might face if this feature is released (fraudulent payments, etc) and a brief overview of the system architecture (what APIs would be used, etc).\\n\\nThe interviewer seems a bit uninterested (probably tired as it was quite late), but was eagerly listening to my idea as I was walking through it. Finally 2 people were selected.\\n\\nTips - \\n\\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1o4cUyyjALT_kTL4g-kmrAUncJz2huLcjZLfi0oBFr4k/edit?usp=sharing - this doc contains my prep for the role; Microsoft conducted an AMA session where they explained clearly about the role and how to prep for it, all of it is given in this doc.\\n\\nCommunicate clearly, think out loud, so that the interviewer understands your thinking process. Take some time to think about an idea before pitching it, but not too much otherwise he might think you’re stuck.\\n\\nPay most attention to customer empathy, identifying user segments and their prioritized pain points in case study as well as interviews.\\n\\nLearn system design as well. It wasn’t asked in my interviews but others were asked about it in detail.\\n\\nAnkita Kanoji(online)\\n\\nRound 1:\\n\\nHe started with Oops. Asked me 4 characteristics of oops. Few dbms questions, what is deadlock, how to identify deadlock situation and how to avoid it. what is 2 phase locking protocol.\\n\\nThere was only one coding question and few follow ups, simple implementation based question.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou are given a code, you need to remove all comments from code there were two types of comments ‘//’ and ‘/*’.\\n\\nFirst follow up: Remove the space between every word of each line.\\n\\nSecond follow up: If there exists a function in the code, just minimize the function name such that every function in the code has a unique name.\\n\\nRound 2:\\n\\nThis was an HR + technical round\\n\\nHe asked me to introduce myself, asked few standard HR questions.\\n\\nThere was only one coding question, detect cycle in a linked list and print the linked list if no cycle exists.\\n\\nShally Kandoi(online)\\n\\nRound 1: (Technical)\\n\\nCoded on text editor (like notepad) while sharing my screen\\n\\nStarted with intro.\\n\\nAsked about my projects which I had written in my resume.

Coding Round:\\n\\n2 easy medium coding questions\\n\\n2. Interview 1 (45 minutes):\\n\\nFirst, the interviewer introduced himself and asked me to briefly introduce myself, after which he shared the link for an online editor and asked me to code the given question. The question was a modified version of the standard frog jump DP question. After writing the code he asked me to analyse the time and space complexity. Post this, he asked me some questions related to normalization and keys in DBMS.\\n\\nWhat is normalization? What are the different types of normalization?\\n\\nWhat are the conditions for a relation to be in BCNF?\\n\\nWhat are primary and foreign keys and give an example for each.\\n\\n3. Interview 2 (45 minutes):\\n\\nThis was also a technical round. There were 2 interviewers, both were very friendly. First, they reviewed my resume and asked me about what motivated me to take up computer science and whether it matched my expectations. Then I was asked to explain my best project. He asked me \\n\\n\\n\\nabout the challenges faced while making the project. My project had used firebase Google authentication so he asked me how Firebase gets Google authentication in the backend (and I did not know the answer to thisK). After this, he asked me some questions about OOPs concepts.\\n\\nWhy should we use OOPs?\\n\\nWhat is polymorphism?\\n\\nWhat are virtual functions and what is their syntax?\\n\\nAfter this, he asked me to code the following question:\\n\\nGiven an array with n integers and a target sum k, find if there exists a contiguous subarray with the given target sum.\\n\\nI first presented the brute force solution and then moved on to the optimized solution. Then he asked me about the internal implementation of an unordered set and what will happen if the size of the unordered set becomes very large, say 1 million. With the help of some hints, I was able to figure out the answer.\\n\\nIn the end, he asked me if I had any questions for him and I asked him about the tech stacks they use.\\n\\nIn general, the interviewers were very encouraging and gave hints whenever I got a little stuck but just make sure to communicate your ideas really well. Be confident and do ask them some question in the end.\\n\\nKshitij Maurya(online)\\n\\nWe had 2 rounds of interviews\\n\\nROUND 1\\n\\nWe introduced ourselves to each other and then he moved on to problems. He shared a link to codility and asked me to code the solution for the problem he presented\\n\\nThe problem was if I have a social media in which people are friends of each other, I need to figure out that if I have 2 people are, they linked to each other. Linked as in if they are friends to each other or if they have a path of friends connecting each other.\\n\\nWe simply had to create people as nodes and the friendships and edges and had to check if the two nodes are in the same connected component. Pretty basic stuff. Although be mindful to write good code with proper variable names and functions. Also keep explaining whatever you are writing to the interviewer\\n\\nThe second question was how would I implement a file system which has the standard functions like cd, pwd, ls. I told how I would use tree to do this, the interviewer asked some more questions on my approach then.\\n\\nROUND 2\\n\\nIn this round the interviewer asked me about my projects and I explained it to him for 10 15 minutes.\\n\\nAfter that he told me that we would be having a discussion where we try to solve a problem. He asked me how would you design a phone book application. Tell 5 features you would like in the app, how would that be implemented, what data structures and algos would be used to implement that. This discussion went on for the rest of the interview and that was it for the round\\n\\nSanjana Kolisetty(online)\\n\\nRound 1 (Technical & Online)\\n\\n\\n\\nThe interviewer just asked me how I was doing and if I’m giving the interview from home or hostel. He didn’t waste any time in introductions and sent me a link to the problem. It was a system design problem. Given a cache, implement the following two methods.\\n\\nCache {\\n\\nadd (key, value, ttl)\\n\\nget (key)\\n\\n}\\n\\nttl is the time for which the key will be available. After ttl time of adding the key, it will be removed from the cache.\\n\\nI asked him how the current time was quantified. He laughed and said that was the problem and allowed me to make assumptions. I told I will declare a class with a map that maps the key to a pair i.e value and endtime which I can find by adding the current time and ttl. I told him my assumptions, say that we get a query after a unit of time. So, the number of the query will be the time. So, add query is taken care of. For the get queries, I can check if the current time is greater than or less than or equal to the endtime and print appropriately. Now, coming to delete the keys, I said I will maintain a set of pairs with endtimes and keys. So, whenever a query is given, I will iterate through the set and delete all the keys from the mapping which have endtimes less than or equal to the currenttime. The interviewer was sceptical throughout the interview. He wasn’t very convinced. He asked me what is the reason for my choice of a set and why a set of pairs specifically. I told him that I want the endtimes to be ordered and I need the key to delete them from the map. He asked me if I can use any other data structure. I said yes and told him how I’ll implement map. I implemented till set and he said he doesn’t want me to implement the map method. He asked me how I’ll manage parallel queries i.e., more than one query at once. I said I don’t know. He asked if I have done OS. I told him that the semester has just started, so I have no idea. He was then convinced with my solution and said that after learning OS, I will be able to do better. He asked if I’ve any questions for him, I asked him if he could introduce himself. He apologized for not introducing and then told me what he does in microsoft.\\n\\nRound 2 (HR + Technical & Online)\\n\\nThe interviewer asked me to introduce myself and he asked me standard questions like why microsoft and all. I said that I like CP and I have done some ML in my introduction. He asked me if I prefer CP or DSA. I said CP. Then he gave the problem. https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-root-to-leaf-numbers/\\n\\nSolution: One dfs traversal and then the sum.\\n\\nYamini Sunil Tasare\\n\\nOnline Interviews\\n\\nRound 1 (Technical)\\n\\nStarted with my introduction, and then he saw my CV.\\n\\nHe did not have any knowledge of ML, so I wasn't asked about any projects.\\n\\nThen he asked my preferred language, I said C++, and then he started asking questions on C++ for like 25 minutes.\\n\\n\\n\\nQuestions were like - > What is stack and heap memory?

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\DELL\\\\OneDrive\\\\Desktop\\\\genai1\\\\data\\\\Internship Interview Experiences\\\\Nimbleedge (both).docx'}, page_content=\"NIMBLEDGEE interveiw questions and experiences\\n\\nSDE\\t\\n\\nAbhinav Ayush : selected\\n\\nThere were two rounds for selection:\\n\\n(i) Technical Round:\\n\\nThis was conducted by professionals from an interview platform - InterviewVector. He first asked me to introduce myself and asked about one of my projects. I was asked to open my leetcode account, and the interviewer gave me a problem. This was already solved by me, which he could see by my submissions. After 4  such problems, we finally reached an unsolved problem, which was this.  I solved it with two unordered maps, and the interviewer was satisfied. He then asked me moderate questions from DBMS, mainly on indexing and how to do it, benefits and drawbacks of B-trees and hashing, which I was able to solve. He then asked me if I knew anything about System Design and its types. I didn’t. He then asked pretty easy questions from OOPs, and difficult ones based on pointers and the like. I was able to answer all from OOPs, and most of them from pointers. He then ended the interview and asked me if I had any questions. I asked about my performance, and he said that my speaking skills and solving skills were good, and I had to brush up on basic portions of C and DBMS. \\n\\n\\tOverall, this interview went well for me. This interview was one of the tougher ones I had given, and required knowledge from all topics - DBMS, OOPs, pointers, CP, etc. Prepare for all topics, and also System Design (if you can). All topics need not be good, but you should be good in CP, as he will ask questions about your code, and why you did what you did in quite detail. \\n\\n(ii) HR Round:\\n\\n\\tThis round was supposed to be of 30 minutes, but went on for about 50 minutes. It was taken by the two founders of the company, but one of them (the ML head) was silent for the entire interview (He was the main interviewer in the ML selection). The interviewer was very friendly and asked me to introduce myself first, and asked me why I wanted to join the SD role. He then gave me a problem with nested list:\\n\\nGiven a nested list, determine the maximum depth.\\n\\nIt is given in the form: [1,2,[3,4,[5,6],[7,[8],9]],11] \\n\\nThe brackets represent the next child.\\n\\nI said that I didn’t know the list data structure, and he asked me to take the input in whatever form I wanted. I took the input in string form, and solved it with the following algorithm:\\n\\nInt var=0, ans=0;\\n\\nIf (s[i]= ‘[‘) var++, ans= max(ans,var);\\n\\n\\n\\nIf (s[i]= ‘]’) var–;\\n\\nThe maximum depth is represented by ans. The interviewers were very surprised by my method, which took me about 2-3 minutes. He then asked me the time complexity, which is O(len), where len= length of the string. The rest of the interview was based on the actual work done by the company, and hence were very different from normal interview questions. He first asked me that if we had a pointer in Kotlin language, and it pointed to a certain location, and we had to use that data in C language, what would be the most appropriate steps. I answered that I would store the address of the pointer, and use the data stored from the pointer in C language with a header file (he said they existed) and something using a void pointer. The answer was wrong, but he was satisfied. He then asked questions like, \\n\\n(i) How would you delete the data used in Kotlin when writing code in C language?\\n\\n(ii) How would you implement garbage collection in C++?\\n\\n(iii) How would you check if a variable is useless in C++ (It is only declared and never used)?\\n\\n(iv) How would you use the string pointer from Kotlin as a char pointer in C?\\n\\n(v) How would you implement your own smart pointer which works in GPU? (I didn’t even know what was GPU)\\n\\nI didn’t know the answer to most of the problems, but I answered whatever I could think of, which he was apparently satisfied by. He then asked me basic questions from Automata Theory, DBMS and OOPs, which I was able to answer. Then we said goodbyes and he ended the meeting.\\n\\nML\\n\\nUmang Jain : selected\\n\\nSo in my interview, there were two rounds.\\n\\nThe first round was divided into two parts: In the first half, he asked me various ML related questions, like Regularization, Bias Variance, Kmeans and KNN, etc. In the second half, he asked me to explain to him any one of my projects. So I had a project which was a combination of NLP and CV, so I explained that to him that, and he asked me various questions about the project. The first round was around 1hr long, and it wasn't that difficult (Also they were mainly searching people with NLP background)\\n\\nThe second round was with the founder. In that round, they were mainly checking how strong the basic knowledge is, and they asked me several situation based questions.\\n\\n\\n\\nQ) Suppose you have two decision trees D1 and D2, and a dataset T1 and T2 which were a subset of a common large dataset. D1 and D2 are trained on T1 and T2 respectively. Now you have to make a third decision tree D3, such that it is robust to both datasets T1 and T2, but T1 and T2 are not accessible to us, and only have access of D1 and D2.\\n\\nThis question was asked to check the thinking in case of an unseen problem. There was no right or wrong answer in this case. \\n\\nAnother question he asked me was, difference between SGD and GD, and which one is better, and why it is better, on an intuitive understanding \\n\\nNext was, consider SVM. Suppose we train a SVM multiple times, with different random initializations in the start, still why do we get the same weights once the training is complete every time. The answer was, because the loss function of SVM is Convex, having a global minimum, and SVM always reaches the global minimum perfectly, giving the same weights at the end.\\n\\nThen he asked me to write pseudo code of a two layered neural network for binary class classification, from scratch, both forward and backward propagation. \\n\\nThis round lasted around 1.5 hrs, and he really wanted to check how strong the basics are of the candidate\"),\n",

I was first asked what\\n\\nprogramming language I prefer and then, I was given a full\\n\\nimplementation of BST in about 2.5 pages in that language. My goal was\\n\\nto find and fix all possible errors in that code. There was no time limit,\\n\\nand the number of errors were also not specified. You had to keep\\n\\nfinding them until you felt that you found them all. These errors include\\n\\nimproper logic, incomplete functions etc. I found about 7 of them in my\\n\\nfirst try, then the interviewer told me that there were 10, so after about 15\\n\\nminutes I found 9 of them.Other students were also asked the same\\n\\nquestion, but their functions were different like the implementation of\\n\\nLinked List, Stack, Queue, Heap etc.\\n\\nDSA Question :\\n\\nThere are n numbers in an array. Each index represents a flower and the\\n\\nnumber in them represents the day when they will bloom. You have to\\n\\nmake m number of bouquets, where each bouquet contains k number of\\n\\nflowers. All those flowers must have already bloomed. And for any\\n\\nindividual bouquet you must choose consecutive flowers from the array.\\n\\nYou have to find the minimum day when you can complete this goal.\\n\\nLater I found this question was from leetcode :\\n\\nMinimum Number of Days to Make m Bouquets - LeetCode\\n\\nWell the solution was a simple binary search on the answer itself.\\n\\nRound 2 / HR Round\\n\\nThis round was mostly focused on projects. The interviewer asked about\\n\\nsome features of the projects, how did you implement them, why did you\\n\\nimplement them etc. Also what was the reason to make the project. He\\n\\neven opened my github to see the project video and screenshots. Apart\\n\\nfrom this, there was some introduction and stuff, and any question if I\\n\\nwant to ask him about the company. This question is usually asked in all\\n\\nHR Round, so I suggest everyone prepare an answer beforehand'),\n",

She asked me to introduce myself and talk about any project on my resume for 5 mins. I talked about the summer intern which I had done and she asked a few questions like why did you do this etc (not that she knew the topic). Then she jumped into the coding question. It was a standard question which I had solved before. I first told about the brute force approach, then told the heap approach which would take O(nlogn) time.\\n\\nhttps://www.interviewbit.com/problems/meeting-rooms/\\n\\n\\n\\nShe did not even tell me to code it, I just explained the pseudocode(probably because of less time), so effectively my interview was only 20-25 mins.\\n\\nRound 2 - (20-25 mins): Technical round\\n\\nAsked me to explain a project on my resume, as I had made decent use of database concepts to store data in it. He questioned me about why I used MongoDb and told me to explain all the tables I had made and their relationship with each other. In that project I had implemented user based access to certain features, so he asked me to write a small snippet of c++ code to implement that. It was very basic like I assumed I had a class called User defined and had functions like isLoggedIn etc. Nothing complicated.\\n\\nRound 3 - (30-35 mins): Technical + hr round\\n\\nThis was probably the longest interview out of the three and the person interviewing seemed like he was at a high position. He asked me to introduce myself and asked about the summer intern I had written in my resume.\\n\\n First he asked me to write a function to find the factorial of a number. I wrote the recursive function and he asked me how recursion works and a few questions about that. He had asked what the recursion stack is called, it has some very specific term, I didn’t know so I said that. He was like it’s okay, maybe it wasn’t taught to you but it is there in any basic C/C++ book. After that he asked me one puzzle- very standard again - https://cdnpractice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/the-3-5-litre-die-hard-water-puzzle.\\n\\nThat was it, he asked me if I knew about the oracle program, I didn’t really know much so I told what I thought Oracle did. He explained a bit about their products and asked if I had any questions.\\n\\nTips:\\n\\nBe confident and always start with a brute force solution and then optimize it. \\n\\nThe interviewers were quite friendly and they generally are, so don’t be scared to clarify things before solving.\\n\\nPrepare dbms concepts well. Mostly what is taught in CS245 is more than enough.\\n\\nGunjal Om Sahebrao : selected\\n\\nRound 1:\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the beginning the interviewer introduced himself and asked me to introduce myself. He asked me to choose any project on which we can talk. Then he asked some standard questions like “Which tech stacks are used in this? What difficulties did you face while making it and how did you tackle it?” and so on.\\n\\nThen he asked some questions on sorting algorithms like which sorting algorithm is best and its time complexity. He asked me to explain heap sort with an example and its time complexity. He gave one medium level coding question and I solved it very fast.\\n\\nRound 2:\\n\\nAt the beginning the interviewer introduced himself and asked me to introduce myself. Then he gave one coding question.\\n\\nQuestion 1: You have given a number. Add the sum of squares of its digits and replace the number with sum. If the given number can be reduced into one then return true else false.\\n\\nApproach: After some iterations if a number is repeated then it can’t be reduced into one so take a set of numbers and do operations until we get one and if the current number is in set then return false.\\n\\nQuestion 2: We have to find the minimum range in array [l, r] such that there are exactly k different numbers. If such a subarray doesn’t exist print “Invalid k”.\\n\\nApproach 1: Traverse through the array and check for every subarray of size k. Take unordered_set and after very iterations check the size of the set .\\n\\nThis is o(n^2) solution so he told me to optimised it.\\n\\nApproach 2: take unorderd_set and unorderd_map and traverse through the array if size of set is k then update your answer accordingly.\\n\\nAfter this he asked some basic questions from dbms and OOPS.\\n\\nAt last I asked one question regarding work culture in oracle.\\n\\nRound 3:(HR)\\n\\nInterviewer introduced himself and then I introduced myself.\\n\\nHe asked some standard HR questions like “Why do you want to be a software engineer? Where do you see yourself in five years? What is your ambition?”.\\n\\nHe asked about the syntax of some basic dbms queries and some OOPS concepts.\\n\\nHe asked me to explain every project and also asked some tech related questions from projects.\\n\\nAt last I asked some questions to him and interview ends.\\n\\nOnline test\\n\\nThere were 4 parts in the online test:\\n\\n1. Coding Section: Here we were required to solve 1 relatively easy coding question. The question that I got was of Maximum Sum Sub Array\\n\\n\\n\\n2. Rest API:\\n\\nThis section was the most unique section of the Oracle test which gave people with prior web development experience a huge advantage over others. We were required to get data from an api given in the question and then work on the response of the api to provide an output ( like counting the frequency of an element in the response etc). \\n\\n3. SQL Section:\\n\\nHere we were given a Table and we were required to write a SQL query to get the required output.\\n\\n4. Coding MCQ:\\n\\nIn this section there were some basic mcq questions on Linked Lists, Trees etc\\n\\nVighnesh Deshpande : selected\\n\\nRound 1 - Technical + HR :\\n\\nThe interviewer in the first round was quite friendly and chill.\\n\\nThe interview began with a basic introduction and then a small general chat about my interests, academics, campus life etc. After this he asked me to explain all the projects listed in my CV. I explained all my projects in detail including the motivation behind the projects. He was not much interested in how exactly I implemented the projects but more on why I worked on that project and what problems I faced. After this he gave a basic coding question which was to be solved live with my screen shared.  \\\\\\n\\nRound 2 - Technical :\\n\\nThis round was the most technically intensive out of all three rounds. The interviewer asked me to design a management system for government buses in bus stands. (He was interested in how I design classes for solving the problem). The discussion on this went on for about 30 mins after which he gave me a coding question post which the interview ended.\\n\\nRound 3 - HR :\\n\\nThis round was mostly technical & HR. The interviewer was very enthusiastic and interactive. She was a highly experienced engineer from the company. After a basic introduction she started going through my resume post which we had a very detailed discussion on one of my projects. After this she asked me a few general HR questions like why Oracle etc. She was really supportive throughout the interview. At the end of the interview we also had a discussion on the scalability of Django in which she also talked about her work at Oracle.\\n\\nSoham Roy : selected\\n\\nRound 1 - Technical (50 mins) :\\n\\nSome CoA questions(cache memory replacement algorithms) and compiler working questions were asked at first and there was a 20-30 minute discussion on those topics. He was impressed with some of my small but important technical knowledge. Then a simple coding question was \\n\\n\\n\\ngiven ( build a tree from its preorder and inorder traversal outputs), after coding it in the recursive approach, I was asked to code it in the Iterative approach.\\n\\nRound 2 - Technical (1 hr) :\\n\\nThe interviewer was pretty chill, he asked me to describe all three projects which I had listed on my resume. After describing all he particularly asked some questions about 1 project( what were the difficulties while doing this project, what are the things you wish to add to this project, why you have used a particular tech stack etc.)\\n\\nThen he asked me about my favorite courses and asked some theoretical DSA questions (my first priority). Then a very basic question of coding was asked( two strings were given, you have to tell if one can be arranged to the other or not) . In the end, some HR-type question was also asked (Why do you want to join Oracle, etc.)\\n\\nRound 3 - HR (1 hr) :\\n\\nThe interviewer asked me if I had done any group project or not, (even if you haven’t done any, try to say some fake story smartly, because a group project leaves good impression), and asked me “how would you convince a company to buy that project from you ?”.Then he gave me a simple coding question to solve( given a sorted array of positive integers return the smallest integer which can not be achieved as the sum of any subset from that array).In the end, he asked some HR questions too (eg. what will you do after graduation, master\\'s or Job? etc.).\\n\\nNayanika Ghosh : selected\\n\\nThere were 3 rounds in total.\\n\\nEach round took place for around 50 mins to 1 hour. \\n\\nThe first round was technical. I was asked to share my screen and solve a coding problem on the personal hackerrank window of the interviewer. After solving, I had to explain the code and he asked me several questions regarding the time complexity. Then I was given a small segment of code to debug. He asked me a lot of conceptual questions from dsa. \\n\\nIn the 2nd round, at first I was asked to explain each of my projects from scratch and the interviewer asked questions related to the projects and the frameworks in between. Also she asked me to explain how I can implement the same project in some other framework. Then she questioned me on some concepts of programming languages (python and C). \\n\\nThe last round was the HR round. No technical question was asked in this round. The interviewer gave a brief overview about the company initially. Then he asked me questions like : \"Why do you want to join Oracle?\",\"Why should we hire you?\",\"What challenges you faced in recent times in your work and how you overcame it?\",etc. \\n\\n(A decent research about the company is always useful.)\\n\\nEvery round ended with the interviewer asking me if I had some questions to ask.\\n\\nThe interviewers were quite student friendly.\\n\\n(Though I wasn\\'t asked, OOPS and DBMS are asked often in the interview).\\n\\nPranav Agarwal : selected\\n\\nI interviewed for the Server Technology Role at Oracle. It was the easiest interview among the companies I had appeared for. \\n\\nI had 3 interviews. \\n\\nFirst was a Technical Round. It went on for about 30 minutes, which was less than what I heard from the other candidates. The questions asked were also easy and directly from interviewbit.\\n\\ni) Find if a pair of numbers has sum equal to target in a sorted array of integers, in n and nlogn time.\\n\\nii) Find depth of a BT\\n\\niii) Find Least Common Ancestor of two given nodes in BT and BST. \\n\\nThey focused more on the quality of answers and the discussion rather than being able to solve difficult questions.\\n\\nThe second round was a HR round and also some conceptual discussion on CS fundamentals. Some of the questions were \\n\\ni) If I am leading a team and some of the members are not able to deliver work on time then how would I deal with such a situation?\\n\\nii) Oracle is looking to launch an existing product in a new market where no one has ever heard of Oracle. How would I make customers switch to Oracle from their existing product?\\n\\nAnd also some other questions on team building and my past experience of working in any team.\\n\\nThen I was asked some theory questions on OS ( I was given a choice of topic.. I answered OS and OOPS ).\\n\\ni) Difference between process and threads.\\n\\nii) Why is process synchronization needed and some ways to achieve it\\n\\nThe third interview was CV and Project Discussion. I was able to make a good impression by giving more in depth answers and discussing the CV myself rather than waiting for the interviewer to read and look for potential questions. \\n\\nOne other question that I remember is “Why should we hire you?”. LInking this answer with relevant past experience is very important.\\n\\nI was also asked some questions on OS\\n\\ni) What is swap memory?\\n\\nii) Benefits of threading\\n\\nKoleti Lavanya\\n\\nRound 1 - Technical + HR :\\n\\nThe interviewer in the first round was quite friendly and chill.\\n\\nThe interview began with a basic introduction and then a small general chat about my interests, academics, campus life etc. After this he asked me to explain all the projects listed in my CV. I explained all my projects in detail including the motivation behind the projects. He asked me a \\n\\n\\n\\nfew questions about how I implemented a few features in my project and later he asked two basic coding questions on hashmaps which I could solve.\\n\\nRound 2 - Technical :\\n\\nThe interviewer is an IITG graduate , he began with a basic introduction and he asked about my projects in detail . After this he asked about hashing algorithms and gave a question on priority queue and asked the implementation of priority queue and discussed time complexities and space complexities related to the question given. At the end we had a small general talk about my interests, academics, campus life etc.\\n\\nRound 3 - HR :\\n\\nThe interviewer was very enthusiastic and interactive. He was a highly experienced engineer from the company. After a basic introduction He started going through my resume and asked about difficulties I faced while I was working on projects . After this he asked me a few general HR questions like why Oracle etc. He was really supportive throughout the interview.\\n\\nB Vijesh R Bhat ( Server Tech) \\n\\nCoding Round:\\n\\nOracle came in Spot-1. The coding round had some easy Math, English aptitude oriented and one coding question. As this round was held online, there were three sets. 2 of them had easy level standard DSA questions and the one I got had a medium-hard level question of LRU cache which had to be modified according to the question’s requirements.\\n\\nTechnical Interview Round 1:\\n\\nI was shortlisted in the Server-Tech module. The Interview just took 15-20 mins, and the interviewer was pretty laid back and unhurried during the interview which obviously calmed my nerves. As he and I both were from Bangalore, he started the conversation by referring to the torrid weather of Guwahati. I just nodded along with him showing agreement to whatever he says. He then asked me two simple questions. One of them was the standard TWO SUM problem (Question 1 on Leetcode) and the other was to count the frequency of each word in a sentence (You would find similar questions on Interviewbit. He said it would be all lowercase and without punctuation when I cross questioned him.) Both problems can be easily solved with unordered maps.\\n\\nHe was happy and then looked at my CV. It had some dev related projects on it and asked a few questions on Socket IO and NodeJS. He then asked me some OS related questions. I told him that OS wasn’t taught to us yet, but that I had scratched the surface a little for Webdev. He seemed impressed and asked me about how NodeJS handles multiple requests from clients. I answered it and he ended the interview.\\n\\nTechnical Interview Round 2:\\n\\nAll of my friends had this round before me lasting around 20-30 mins and reportedly they were grilled on OOPS and basic DSA. Wasn’t the case with me. My Interviewer had just ended a 50 mins interview and before I could discuss with the interviewee, I was called for the interview. It lasted for 50 mins. The interviewer seemed a tad rude and straight up asked me to write (Would advise you guys to practice writing the code on paper as many companies expect this. Doesn’t mean that you sit writing each problem you solve) the code for the Matrix chain multiplication problem whose link is below: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/matrix-chain-multiplication-dp-8/\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is a standard DP problem and CSE/MnC guys will have this in their 4th semester course. I hadn’t revised this problem and the last time I did it was probably 2-2.5 months prior to the Interview. I had a rough idea but didn’t know the exact code. I panicked and gave him absolute nonsense answers. He then stopped me right there and told me to write the code for 2 easier problems to ease the stress. Both were simple DP questions. One of them was the tabulation of Fibonacci and\\n\\nThe other was the 0/1 knapsack problem. He was happy with both the solutions and gave me an option of ending the Interview or continuing to solve the MCM problem he initially gave. For obvious reasons I chose to solve the problem and this time I solved it within 2 mins (Probably I just needed a warmup of sorts). He later said that I did well and also said that he too graduated from IITG just a few years back (MTech CSE).\\n\\nHR Round:\\n\\nThe HR round was pretty mellow. The interviewer was an old man and was the software head in the company. He asked me standard HR questions. Some of them were: Define success in your own words. What is your ideal job? What three qualities would your friends describe you when asked them? Give an instance of when you handled pressure well and bore good results. He was honestly dumbfounded by my lucidity and appreciated my confidence. There was another young lady who then asked me my location preferences and about relocation. Overall, it was an enriching experience I would say. Got selected later :)\\n\\nPratham Goyal \\n\\nOracle: Server Tech. Role\\n\\nInterview Round 1: Technical Round \\n\\nAround 35 to 40 minutes. First round of interview started with introduction \\n\\nof the interviewer and then he asked me to introduce myself. Then he \\n\\nasked me that if know about Binary Search Trees, as I replied positively so \\n\\nhe asked me to write code of finding and adding elements to a BST (Take \\n\\ncare of base cases while writing code as I forgot to write base case for \\n\\nempty BST). Then he asked me about projects, to talk about my all three \\n\\nprojects. He picked one of my projects which was a campus cart app for \\n\\nIITG. He asked questions like, how many peoples your app can handle? If \\n\\nyou want to increase number of parallel users, how will you do it? Basically, \\n\\nDatabase Management questions about my project (Indexing, which sorting \\n\\ntechnique we use in it?). Discussed this for about 15 minutes. Then he \\n\\nasked me to explain ACID properties of DBMS with example. At last, he told \\n\\n“If you have any questions you may ask?” Prepare some questions which \\n\\nyou may ask at last of an interview it shows your willingness to join the \\n\\ncompany. \\n\\nInterview Round 2: Technical Round \\n\\nAround 55 to 60 minutes. Second round started with my introduction. Then \\n\\nhe directly started asking questions on DSA, Dynamic programing to be \\n\\nspecific. He asked me 3 standard questions from DP and asked me to write \\n\\nfull code for all three on paper. \\n\\n3 questions: \\n\\n\\n\\n1) Nth Fibonacci number \\n\\n2) 0/1 knapsack problem \\n\\n3) 3\\n\\nrd I do not rememberգդե (But it was basic)\\n\\nBasically, this round was fully DSA based. He was happy, as I have done all \\n\\nthree questions quite fast and was able to explain him. At last, he asked the \\n\\nsame question “If you have any questions you may ask?”, as my interviewer \\n\\nwas Alumni of IITG, So I talked with him about college for a few minutes.\\n\\nInterview Round 3: HR Round \\n\\nAbout 5-10 minutes, It was like normal conversation, Interviewer was also \\n\\ntired as it was 7pm and interviews started at 9am. So he asked me a few \\n\\nquick questions like \\n\\n1) What is success for you? \\n\\n2) How you handle Pressure situations? \\n\\n3) If you have power to change something in this world, what will you \\n\\nchange? \\n\\n4) If you have power to change something in IITG, what will you change? \\n\\n5) If I ask your friends, what 3 features will they talk about you? \\n\\nAt the end he did a handshake with me and said take some rest.\\n\\nPriyanshu Mahawar\\n\\nRound 1 (45-60 mins)\\n\\nInitially, I was asked a simple DSA question about Valid Sudoku Valid\\n\\nSudoku - LeetCode . Following that, I was given two problems and asked to\\n\\nwrite their SQL queries, which involved the use of joins , group by clauses.\\n\\nHe also asked me about serializability in SQL, i.e., view serializability and\\n\\nconflict serializability. He asked me about the different ways I can solve the\\n\\nproblem of multiple users writing and reading a database.Then, he asked\\n\\nme to explain one of my projects in detail . The project discussion went on\\n\\nfor about 25-30 mins.\\n\\nRound 2 (20-25 mins)\\n\\nThe interviewer first asked me to briefly explain one of my projects. He then\\n\\nasked how I could improve my project, such as things I could have done\\n\\ndifferently , how I would expand it. He also asked me about the difference\\n\\nbetween C++ and Python (I had written both in my technical skills). He\\n\\nasked me to briefly explain the different keys in DBMS. He gave me a\\n\\nDBMS problem and asked how I would write an SQL query (he didn’t ask\\n\\nme to write it, just the logic). He also asked about the steps I take when an\\n\\nerror occurs in the code. Finally, he asked me why I want to be a software\\n\\n\\n\\nengineer.\\n\\nRound 3 (5 mins - HR Round)\\n\\nBy the time my turn came, it had gotten quite late, so they called 4-5\\n\\nstudents together. They simply asked us how we felt about the interview\\n\\nprocess and the locations where we were comfortable working.\\n\\nKushanava Ghosh\\n\\nThe interview shortlisting was based on OA (1 Coding Question + MCQs based on CS Fundamentals).\\n\\nI was selected for the interview in Apps Role. The interview consisted of 3 Rounds (2 Technical + 1 (Technical + HR)).\\n\\nRound 1 (Technical Round) (40 mins):\\n\\nThe interviewer started the interview with his introduction and then asked me to do the same. He saw my CV and asked me to briefly explain him about the 1st project. He then questioned me about some basic stuff like pros and cons of features in my projects and asked about conflicting scenarios which can happen in my project, I was able to answer this questions pretty confidently as I was having a good command over my project understanding.\\n\\nHe continued the interview asking me 1 simple DSA question based on matrices: https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-image/description/ and asked me to write the code on paper (not laptop 😂).\\n\\nRound 2 (Technical Round) (30 mins):\\n\\nThis round was purely based on projects. The interview started as usual with his introduction followed by my introduction. He asked me to explain my very 1st project in detail like how the architecture (project structure) is made, what tech-stack I had used, and many more. After answering all those simple questions, he started to ask me system design questions based on my project. He gave me the requirement and I had to build the complete architecture such as database schema, frontend and backend stuff etc. (Just to explain it on paper & not code). This round went well than expected :)\\n\\nRound 3e being questioned based on what you are saying in the interview (Technical + HR Round) (45 mins):\\n\\nThe round was more like you ar. So, first he introduced himself followed by me. He then asked me to explain my first project and draw the architecture of the project. He then asked some basic stuff why you used REST API framework, if you use SOAP framework, what changes you had to make. What’s the difference between C++ and JS, why you preferred JS over C++ for developing your web application and yeah I was able to answer this set of questions. \\n\\n\\n\\nHe then asked to solve two DSA question (had to write code on paper) which were pretty simple to solve:\\n\\nReverse a number using pointers\\n\\nGiven a number, write it’s text format\\n\\nEg:  Input : 19 => Output : Nineteen\\n\\nHe then ended the interview asking some standard HR type questions.\\n\\nTips for Cracking this interview:\\n\\nProjects are important !!!. You should be well versed with your project. They can ask any kind of question related to your project so understand the project completely before putting it into your resume.\\n\\nHave a good grip on DSA standard questions (You can follow Striver’s A2Z sheet for this).\\n\\nYou should have a strong command on CS Fundamentals.'),\n",

After introducing myself, he asked me about an experience mentioned in my CV( It was an exam which I cracked, with the first prize being a trip to Moscow). He then told me that he has also been to Moscow, and that the company has annual international trips and some more points about their culture and after all of this he started sharing his screen. First few questions were starters, which involved finding out time complexities.\\n\\nInt i = 0, j;\\n\\nWhile (i<n) {\\n\\n\\tj=2;\\n\\n\\twhile(j<n)\\n\\n\\t{\\n\\n\\t\\tj=j*j;\\n\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\ni++;\\n\\n} \\n\\nAns: O(nlog(logn))\\n\\nOne more was there, it was easier than this and complexity was O(n^(3/2))\\n\\nHe then asked me to figure out what this piece of code is doing\\n\\nj = 1, i = m;\\n\\nwhile(i-j<eps) {\\n\\n\\ti=(i+j)/2;\\n\\n\\tj=m/i;\\n\\n}\\n\\nWhile I was telling him my thought process for this problem, He figured out it should not be int and rather than double and changed the problem for doubles and then i solved it for doubles.\\n\\nHe then asked about heaps, I dont remember exactly but the main question was related to the relation between the number of leaves and internal nodes. I solved it using some good arguments and he told me that he has not listened to this sort of approach in any past interviews.\\n\\nHe then asked me to solve a recurrence relation: T(n) = 3*T(n-1) + 2^n\\n\\nT(0)=1\\n\\nAns: T(n) = 3^(n+1) - 2^(n+1)\\n\\nHe then asked me a puzzle: He asked whether I have ever heard about russian roulette, I replied no. He continued and told me, we have a revolver with a bullet inside it and he fired it at himself and no bullet came out and now I have to fire it on myself. What will be more beneficial for me?: To directly fire it on myself or give it a shuffle before firing it on me. Then another variant, this time 2 bullets adjacent to each other, And one last variant was 2 bullets with a slot \\n\\n\\n\\ngap. And finally we had a discussion about what minimum number of gaps would be ideal between 2 bullets.(Actually when he ended the last variant I just pondered upon the ideal gap between 2 bullets and then we had a chat on this problem). In between one expectation question was also there: what is the expected number of fires required to get a bullet out?\\n\\nIn the end I asked him to tell me about his experience in the company and how well I performed. He replied that he was impressed by the way I approached the russian roulette problem. And then talked about his experience and then told me to wait for the next interviewer in the same meet link\\n\\nRound 2: The interviewer joined and started with the problem:\\n\\nWe have even and odd numbers and have to bring all the odd numbers on the left side and all the even numbers on the right side with their relative order being preserved.\\n\\nI gave him an inefficient approach in the first few minutes and then he told me to optimize further. Then I told him we can do it efficiently using the merge sort tree approach and also told him what would be the bottleneck: Somehow we have to do the merge step in O(n) time and O(1) space so that it could be boiled down to O(nlogn). He agreed and told me I was in the right direction and asked me to proceed further. I asked for some time and after some 5-8 minutes I thought of an approach which was a bit clumsy, but intuitively I felt it can merge in O(n) time and O(1) space. I took 2 more minutes to frame my approach and then I told him my approach and then gave him a very mathematical proof of correctness and proof for time complexity also and space complexity was obvious because everything was done inplace. He followed each of my step and in the end I asked that I can explain one more time more slowly for better clarity but he told me that he understood my solution and he feels its correct, but it's a bit complex and implementation heavy maybe, he had a better approach and told me his approach for merge operation: To reverse first half, reverse second half and then in the end reverse the whole array in the merge operation. I acknowledged his awesome approach and then asked about how much time he is in the company and his experience.\\n\\nIn the end, the head of HR had a meet with me. She told me that it's not allowed by the ccd but she is telling me that I am selected. And then after telling this, she went in depth of the company details and culture. She also tried asking my priorities and whether I have applied to some other Hft like Tower etc. She was trying to convince me by telling me that my feedback was very good and why I will be an asset to the company and how the company would benefit me. Also describing how the company pays the competitive compensation and how they acknowledge hard work and unique solutions.\\n\\nTips:\\n\\nAlways have a good knowledge about whatever you write on your cv.(Like I never expected that the interviewer would ask me about the Moscow exam, as it was mentioned in the very end of my cv)\\n\\n\\n\\nAlways tell whatever approach you are thinking of. I was telling him the approach and then he realized it should be double and not int.\\n\\nTry to give rigorous mathematical proofs for your approaches. This is well taken by the interviewers.\\n\\nNever be afraid of the interviewer, you can ask him/her any professional question you feel is important for you. You can even appreciate or acknowledge his/her unique question or creative solution.\\n\\nIn the end leave an impression that you are interested in the company. This could help even if your chances are a bit low, because the company sees the enthusiasm you have for the company.\\n\\nTry not to tell your preference to anyone, Quadeye is famous for asking preferences and revealing their selections in the interview itself. Also please note that because the ccd also knows this, students shortlisted for Quadeye will have to submit their company preference list before the interview starts, this was a very big shock for us, so decide your priority list as soon as you are shortlisted for their interviews.\\n\\nNote: Quadeye gives high preference to CPI for shortlisting only, after that even if it's low among the peers who qualified, it won't matter because then your interview will matter more. But while shortlisting CPI has very high importance.\\n\\nDivyam\\n\\nRound 1 -\\n\\nAsked me about time complexities in heaps and BST. Asked some basic coding questions like -\\n\\nAll elements of the array repeats twice except one. Find that element - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-element-appears-array-every-element-appears-twice/\\n\\nAll elements of the array repeats thrice except one. Find that element - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-the-element-that-appears-once/\\n\\nWhy can’t sorting algorithms be faster than O(nlogn)\\n\\nIn an array from 1 to n, one element is missing and one is repeated twice. Find both these elements - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-a-repeating-and-a-missing-number/\\n\\nRound 2 -\\n\\nGiven an array, arrange all negative numbers to the front before all positive numbers. The mutual ordering of positive numbers and negative numbers respectively should be the same. Coded first using the idea insertion sort. Then using the idea of merge sort with constant space - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rearrange-positive-and-negative-numbers/.\\n\\nRound 3 -\\n\\nAsked me 3 puzzles -\\n\\nTime complexity -\\n\\nInt i = 0, j;\\n\\nWhile (i<n) {\\n\\n\\tj=2;\\n\\n\\twhile(j<n)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t{\\n\\n\\t\\tj=j*j;\\n\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\ni++;\\n\\n} \\n\\nAns - nloglogn\\n\\nWhat does this code approximate -\\n\\nInt j = 1, i = m;\\n\\nwhile(i-j<eps) {\\n\\n\\ti=(i+j)/2;\\n\\n\\tj=m/i;\\n\\n}\\n\\nAns - sqrt(m)\\n\\nPerson A bought Rs 200 worth item from person B, but he didn’t have change so gave B a note of Rs 2000. B asked his friend C to give him change of Rs 2000 and he gave Rs 1800 to A. Now C realised that the note was fake, so B gave him Rs 2000 back. What is the loss of B?\\n\\nAns - Rs 2000\\n\\nRitish:-\\n\\nFirst Round : \\n\\nFirstly asked to introduce myself\\n\\nAsked about time complexities of sorting algorithms like merge sort and quick-sort\\n\\nAsked  about drawbacks of merge sort. Sol :- It uses extra space\\n\\nAsked a puzzle. Given 2 beakers one of 3L and other of 5L and asked to measure 4L and you have an infinite supply of water.              Sol : Firstly fill 3L then put it into 5L then again fill 3L and put 2L in 5L to make it full and you have 1L in 3L now empty 5L beaker and again put that 1L water in 5L and just again put 3L of water in 3L and put in 5L and 5L will have exactly 4L of water.\\n\\nSecond Round : \\n\\nFirstly asked language I am comfortable with and I said C++ but he was a java programmer., So he asked me difference between C++ and java I said C++ is more faster than java and C++ supports multiple inheritance but java doesn’t and I said that there was no unsigned integers in java and c++ has(not sure about it but i said it.)\\n\\nThen he asked me about inheritance and oops concepts like use of new and delete.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen he asked me about questions on how heap is build and map is build and there time complexities of insertion and deletion\\n\\nThen he asked if every number is given twice and only one number is once. Find it Sol: take xor of all numbers and then he extends it to that if every number is present thrice and only one number is once. Find it Sol : Firstly I told about hashing and map and then he asked to optimize it then I told him about storing the bits of every number and traversing bits if any bit count%3==1 then it is a bit of that number and he was convinced.\\n\\nThird Round : \\n\\nHe just asked a language for programming and started asking the question which was the same as this:  https://codeforces.com/contest/1554/problem/A. Sol : Firstly I told him about O(n^3) approach and was asked to optimise it and then I told him about O(n^2) approach and he asked me optimise further and then I told him about my observation from question and told him O(n) approach and then he asked me to prove my observation. I proved it in some way using induction and he was satisfied by the induction process and  then he asked a lot of variants as if there were negative numbers, also if max value would be taken as absolute and other more. I was able to crack most of its variants and one or two with hints.\\n\\nFourth Round (HR round - 10 min) :  \\n\\nIt was a simple daily life conversation with her about covid and iit campus and normal routine and I asked 2-3 questions about the company.\\n\\nTips to crack interview:\\n\\nCpi is given a lot of preference so make sure it must be above 9.2(systems) and 9.4(quant).\\n\\nMinor in maths is preferred\\n\\nIf you don’t know anything just say it.They will not ask you from those topics but might ask why you haven’t studied these topics.\\n\\nVineet:-\\n\\nI preferred quant profile so my interview was almost completely about probability and two very basic coding questions were asked.\\n\\nIs 1000343 or 3599 a prime number?\\n\\n\\n\\nFive players play in a tournament with a scoring policy of win-2, tie-1, lose-0, given scores of four players, find the score of the last one?\\n\\nTwo players play a tennis match, P1 wins with probability p. If sets of three are played, will the game end in two sets or in three?\\n\\nGiven an unfair coin, how will you use it for fair trials?\\n\\nYou have to choose three points on the circumference of a circle. What is the probability that the centre of the circle lies in the Triangle formed?\\n\\nDiscussion on projects.\\n\\nAniket:-\\n\\nFor : Systems Role\\n\\nThe shortlisting for interviews was done based on the CV and CPI.\\n\\nI had to go through 5 rounds of interview so I don’t quite remember what questions were asked in which round so I am just listing the questions.\\n\\nIntroduce yourself.\\n\\nInterviewer asked me to explain two of my projects that he picked.\\n\\nSimple questions from Interview bit:\\n\\nhttps://www.interviewbit.com/problems/single-number/\\n\\nhttps://www.interviewbit.com/problems/single-number-ii/\\n\\nhttps://www.interviewbit.com/problems/list-cycle/\\n\\nGiven two sorted arrays A of size m+n and B of size n, the last n positions of A are empty, you have to return the sorted merge array in A itself.\\n\\nSo, basically you can maintain 3 pointers, one at the end of A, one at the last entry of A and one at the  last entry of B. The first pointer is used to fill final values, whichever value pointed to by the other two pointers is greater is filled and that pointer is decremented until it becomes 0. Doing so would give you the sorted array.\\n\\nWhat sort can be done in O(1) space and O(nlogn) time:\\n\\nHeap sort, everytime popping the top value from the heap.\\n\\nWhat is the time complexity of building a heap from a given array.\\n\\nO(n), the proof was not asked but one should know.\\n\\nHow do you delete an entry from the heap\\n\\nWe recursively replace the node with its child, while maintaining the heap property(min or max heap) until it becomes a leaf node, and then we delete it.\\n\\nShift all the negative numbers in the array on the left while maintaining their order and using constant extra space and linear time.\\n\\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/move-negative-numbers-beginning-positive-end-constant-extra-space/\\n\\nI was asked some puzzles:\\n\\nA spider builds a complete web in 15 days, everyday it doubles the work it does, at what day will it build 25% of the web. Ans: 13 days.\\n\\nYou have two jars of 3 litrs and 5 litrs, how will you measure 4 lits, well completely fill 5 lits, then pour into 3lits jar, 2lits remain in 5lits jar, empty 3lits and pour the 2lit water in 5lit jar in 3lits jar, now, completely fill 5lits, and pour into 3lit until it is full upto the brim, you have 4lit in 5lit jar.\\n\\nj) The HR round: The HR was really friendly, she asked if I had any doubts about the company, and my interview experience so far. Then she convinced me why Quadeye was a better choice compared to other Algorithmic trading companies according to my requirements. Then she unofficially gave me the offer.\\n\\nThe overall experience was very nice, they really made me comfortable and helped me wherever I was stuck, they even conversed in Hindi so there was no communication barrier. It was easier compared to other interviews that I sat for. \\n\\nAadarshraj Sah\\n\\nCV based shortlisting. \\n\\nInterview 1\\n\\nShort Intro\\n\\nPrint all the set bit  subsets of the number (Eg-> for 5 (101) , print 1 (001), 4 (100) , 5(101) )\\n\\nIn an array find the maximum number of non overlapping subarrays within which there is a contiguous segment with sum S.\\n\\nPuzzle ( https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-39-hundred-coin-puzzle/ )\\n\\nInterview 2\\n\\n( https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sort-an-array-of-0s-1s-and-2s/ )\\n\\nDifference between normal maps and unordered maps and the implementation behind each of them.\\n\\nMukul Lakra\\n\\nRound 1 : Technical round\\n\\nQ1) How many times the following loop will run?\\n\\nfor(char i=0; i<300;i++){\\n\\n\\t;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t;\\n\\n}\\n\\nIt would be an infinite loop and then the interviewer asked me that why would it be an infinite loop.\\n\\nQ2) He asked me about the probability of at least two students having the same birthday in a classroom of n students.\\n\\nQ3) Given an  array. For each element of an array , find the product of all elements excluding the one selected . I told him the approach using division. Then , he asked me to do it without division . I gave him the basic approach in O(n^2). Then , he asked me to propose O(n) solution. He gave me a hint to use the prefix sum like approach. Then , I got it. We can make two arrays , one with prefix product and one with suffix product and the product of corresponding terms of those arrays give us the answer we want.\\n\\nQ4) Maximum subtree sum problem.\\n\\nRound 2 : Technical round\\n\\nAsked me about one of my projects and as it was based on python , he asked me about python decorators and the minimax algorithm used in the program.\\n\\nQ1) Explain a bit about linked lists..\\n\\nQ2) What are the differences between linked lists and arrays and tell about any case where linked lists are more useful than the arrays.\\n\\nTold the difference , and the case is when we have to delete an element within the linked list.\\n\\nQ3) How to find out whether a linked list has a loop or not?\\n\\nI told we can use map or we can use two pointer approach where one skips two nodes at a time while other does 1 node at a time . If they get same value sometime , there is a loop.\\n\\nBoth interviews were short and lasted for a combined total of 40 minutes.\\n\\nVedant Shah\\n\\nRound 1:\\n\\nSimple Introduction.\\n\\nAsked me a very simple question.\\n\\nQ1) Given an sorted array with numbers having multiple entries, how would you find the count of a particular number?\\n\\nBrute Force:\\tSimply iterate the array and find the count\\n\\nCan be optimized?\\n\\n\\n\\nAs array is sorted, apply binary search 2 times.Find the index of the first occurrence of the target number and then apply binary search again to find the last index of the target number.\\n\\nHe then asked me to code it.\\n\\nRound 2:\\n\\nQ1) How many times the following loop will run?\\n\\nfor(char i=0; i<300;i++){\\n\\n\\t;\\n\\n\\t;\\n\\n}\\n\\nQ2) https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/right-view-of-binary-tree/\\n\\n\\tI was asked to code this on google doc.\\n\\nQ3) GIven an array(arr) of integers. Construct another array(brr) such that brr[i] = product of all numbers of arr except arr[i]. You can’t use division.\\n\\nHe just asked me my approach.\\n\\nWe would maintain a prefix multiplication and suffix multiplication array, and then brr[i]=pre[i-1]*suff[i+1]\\n\\nOverall Experience:\\n\\nQuestions asked to me were very simple. Anyone with basic knowledge of DSA could have easily cracked the interview.\\n\\n\\n\\nVatsal Gupta:\\n\\n>List Cycle Algorithm\\n\\n>Finding start in list cycle\\n\\n>Standard DP edit distance\\n\\n>Modification to linked list to employ the best possible DLL\\n\\n>OOPS overriding/overloading\\n\\n>OOPS virtual functions\\n\\n>Going down and finding maximum 0s in the matrix.\\n\\nI asked:\\n\\n> Work-Life balance and mobility between quant/systems roles\\n\\nSHIVAM GARG(Systems)\\n\\nGENERAL :\\n\\n> Shortlisting for the interviews was based on CPI and no test was conducted. We were informed about the same a day before the interview.\\n\\n> All the interviews were short and were conducted online.\\n\\nROUND 1 :\\n\\n> The interviewer did not ask me to introduce myself or anything. He started off with a DSA question which turned out to be one that quadeye had asked 2 years ago which i had read about in that year’s interview exp doc. This was the question -> codeforces.com/contest/1554/problem/A\\n\\n> The second question was a puzzle : you are given a 2^n x 2^n grid and you have to tile this grid using L shaped tiles of area 3 units i.e the simplest L while ensuring that a minimum number of tiles are left over.\\n\\nAnswer : The answer was 1 for every value of n.\\n\\nThe interview gave very less time for this question and asked for the solution after 2-3 minutes, he did not give a hint when I asked him for one and moved on to the next question.\\n\\n>The third question was on OOPS he asked how do we access a private member of a class outside the class.\\n\\nAnswer: Friend function/class.\\n\\nROUND 2:\\n\\n> Asked me about generating random numbers in c++ , basically asked about the rand() function and how it works then he gave me a DSA question based on rand().\\n\\n> Question1 : You are given a list of n songs and an integer k, you have to select a random song from the given list in each iteration but after you choose a song it gets blocked for the next k iterations and should not be selected. Implement a way to sample from the list of available songs and also ensure that the probability is same for all the available songs.\\n\\n\\n\\n> He gave me a hint after a minute that the question could be solved using a queue after I told him a basic approach that had O(n^2) complexity. He did not give me much time after that and moved on to the next question.\\n\\n> Question2: What are virtual functions ?\\n\\nROUND 3:\\n\\n> Interviewer asked whether I had applied for other HFTs and companies. He then asked where I lived and my first preference among the companies I was sitting for, answer these questions based on the guidelines given to you by the placement cell. However the interviewer got more interested when I told him that quadeye was my first preference.\\n\\n> Question1 : Give me a set of 10 numbers such that choosing any 3 numbers out of them will not form a triangle.\\n\\nAnswer : I immediately answered that we could take powers of 2 i.e 2^1 , 2^2 , 2^3 ……\\n\\nHe then told me that the question could have multiple answers and he wanted the one where the 10th number is minimum.\\n\\nI gave the correct answer after a minute : Fibonacci Sequence(1,1,2,3,5,.....)\\n\\n> Question2 : He then went on to OOPS and asked me about virtual functions and asked me to give me a proper use case of virtual functions with explanation.\\n\\nAnswer2: I told him about function overriding and gave a scenario where we have to feed different kinds of animals for which we have a base class called animal and several derived classes like dog , cat etc. Now some of the derived classes have a dedicated feed function\\n\\nAnd for the others we have to use the generic function defined in the base class. Virtual functions can be used for these kinds of situations.\\n\\nROUND 4(HR):\\n\\n> General discussion about my motivation and goals in life, my role model and inspiration etc.\\n\\n> Lasted for about 20 minutes.\\n\\n> HR round was non-eliminatory.\\n\\nGENERAL TIPS:\\n\\n> CPI and department ranks are important, I was asked about my department rank in the 3rd interview.\\n\\n> C++ proficiency and OOPS concepts are very important.\\n\\n> Interviews were short(15-20 mins each) and I was expected to answer each question within a few minutes.Might depend on your interviewer and question, some of the people got more time than me.\\n\\n> No need to study networks and OS, told my interviewer that we didn’t have any courses on these topics and he moved on.\\n\\n> Make sure your CV highlights your department rank and academic achievements such as olympiads, IMS, JEE ranks, ICPC etc.\\n\\n\\n\\n> Make sure that you sound interested in joining Quadeye as compared to other firms.\\n\\nTanish (Systems)\\n\\nGENERAL :\\n\\n> Resume-Based Shortlisting (13 students were shortlisted)\\n\\n> 9+ CPI cut-off and they separately ask for combined CPI in Maths + CS courses only.\\n\\n> 5 students for the system's role + 1 student for the quant role were given the final offer.\\n\\nROUND 1: Technical\\n\\nThe interviewer just asked my name in the beginning and he proceeded with the questions. The interviewer talked in Hindi for the whole of Round 1.\\n\\nQ1 -> Tell whether a given number is a perfect power of 2 or not using bitwise operators.\\n\\nAns ->  n&n-1=0 if perfect power of 2.\\n\\nQ2 -> Give 10 numbers such that no three numbers can be sides of a triangle.\\n\\nAns -> Take 10 numbers as powers of 2.\\n\\nQ3 -> How can protected properties and methods used outside a class?\\n\\nQ4 -> Explain virtual functions with their application.\\n\\nROUND 2: Technical\\n\\nQ1 -> Given a tree whose each node is associated with a weight. Delete an edge that minimizes the subtree sum difference. He then asked some more questions related to inserting a node, deleting a node, etc. optimally for the preprocessed tree that I used in this question.\\n\\nQ2 -> Given a 2n x 2n grid and L-shaped tiles having vertical and horizontal parts of length = 2 and width = 1. If you fill the grid optimally how many empty tiles will be left at minimum?\\n\\nAns -> For 2X2 ans is 1. Now 4x4 problem can be reduced to a 2x2 problem by first filling the cells adjacent to the edges. In this way, any problem can be reduced into one level lower sub-problem and we are always left with a 2x2 grid. So, ans is 1 in all the cases.\\n\\nQ3 -> Explain the diamond problem and how we solve this problem.\\n\\nQ4 -> Inheritance and its types?\\n\\nROUND 3: Technical\\n\\nQ1 -> Given a set of n distinct elements. Answer the following questions:\\n\\nNumber of subsets possible. {2n}\\n\\nNumber of subsets having even length. {2n-1}\\n\\nThe sum of sum of elements all possible subsets.\\n\\n [ Ex. {1,2}  Ans = (1)+(2)+(1+2)+(0) ]\\n\\n Ans : {2n-1 *(sum of elements of set)}\\n\\nThe sum of the product of elements of all possible subsets:\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t [ Ex. {1,2}  Ans = (1)+(2)+(1*2)+(0) ]\\n\\n Ans : {(1+a1) * (1+a2) * (1+a3) ……. *(1+an) -1}\\n\\nQ2 -> Questions related to Memory distribution in C++ and Run Time Polymorphism.\\n\\n\\tHe asked 1 or 2 more medium-level DSA questions.\\n\\nNOTE: They also took the HR round in the end but it was just for formality. Whoever reached the HR round got selected.\\n\\nGENERAL TIPS:\\n\\nThey only asked DSA and C++/OOPS-related questions. DSA questions were not that hard and with a basic understanding of the concepts one can easily solve them. Try interacting with the interviewer while thinking of the solution because in case you are \\n\\n\\n\\nunable to solve at least he will get to know how close you were to the solution. Most of the time they give hints too.\\n\\nAchintya Gupta\\n\\nShortlisting based on CPI and CV.\\n\\nInterview 1: Technical\\n\\nNo intros, they started straight with a CP question- Given an array of positive integers, find\\n\\nthe maximum product of Max and Min element of the subarray for any subarray.\\n\\nI didn’t have any clue so I just started with the brute force n^2 solution and told him a few\\n\\ncases like if the 2 max elements are together, that will obviously be the answer.\\n\\nHe told me to think and give a better solution in O(n). I couldn’t think of it so he gave a hint\\n\\nthat think of subarrays of lengths 1 and 2. And I realised that the answer will always be in a\\n\\nsubarray of length 2 and gave him the approach.\\n\\nThen he asked if I know OS and Networks, I said no and he moved on to OOPS questions\\n\\nWhat is inheritance\\n\\nWhat are the different types of inheritance\\n\\nWhat happens in public, private and protected inheritance\\n\\nWhat about private variables in these, can they be accessed by child class\\n\\nWhat is const keyword- I told about the const for variables, he then asked about const\\n\\nfunctions. I told him that in these functions class variables cannot be updated. He then asked\\n\\nso can you return a reference of class variable, since you are not changing it inside the\\n\\nfunction (I said yes but the answer is No, only constant reference can be returned).\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is typedef and #define? What’s the difference between them? Why can’t you just use\\n\\n#define instead of typedef?\\n\\nThis round lasted about 15 minutes.\\n\\nInterview 2- Technical\\n\\nThe interviewer started talking in Hindi and asked if I was comfortable and where I am from\\n\\nnatively. He then started directly with the questionsGive me 10 positive integers no 3 of which will form sides of a triangle (I answered first 10\\n\\nFibonacci numbers, but obviously anything like powers of 2 works)\\n\\nHe then asked about virtual functions and its use.\\n\\nHow would you check if a number is a power of 2- I said it has exactly 1 set bit and we can\\n\\ncheck it using C++ built-in function. He said to do it without function and I gave the division\\n\\nloop answer.\\n\\nYou are given a tree where each node has a weight. Weight of any tree is the sum of weights\\n\\nof its children. How would you remove an edge such that the difference between the weights\\n\\nof two newly formed trees is minimum. I gave the subtree recursive approach in O(n).\\n\\nThe final question was to convert an integer to a character array which was again fairly\\n\\nsimple.\\n\\nHe asked me about my preferred company and if I am sitting for any other companies. I\\n\\nobviously said that I would love to work at Quadeye and I’ll give it a preference. He told me I\\n\\nhad mostly positive feedback and with this, my interview lasted a grand total of 7 minutes\\n\\nSreehari C\\n\\nInterview cutoff on the basis of CPI.\\n\\nHad 2 rounds after which I was rejected.\\n\\nRound 1:-\\n\\n\\n\\nBasic OOPS like virtual functions, runtime polymorphism , compile time polymorphism , smart pointers, why are they used, how to implement it, how does compiler know how many bites to delete when invoked delete operator, etc\\n\\nAsked a bit of COA like-pipelining,  Branch Predictor, How is it used, in which stage of pipeline it is invoked, how to implement it using FSM etc\\n\\nBasic CP qn:-\\n\\n\\tGiven 2 linked list, find the common node.\\n\\nRound 2(10 min):-\\n\\nAsked where I am from. \\n\\nAsked one puzzle:-\\n\\n\\tForm 10 numbers such that no 3 of which form a triangle.\\n\\nAns:- Fibonacci numbers\\n\\nAsked about virtual functions.\\n\\nAsked whether I am ok to work in Gurgaon and systems role, to which I replied Yes.\\n\\nAfter that Interview is over\\n\\nNote:- Quadeye gives high preference to North Indians.\\n\\nChandrashekhar Dharmarajan\\n\\nIntern Offered\\n\\nShortlisting : Based on CV and CPI  . Mostly shortlisting is based on CPI   .. \\n\\nRound 1 : \\n\\n\\tInterviewer asked for an introduction and quickly moved on to a CP question . The question was as follows  , you are given an array and ‘q’ queries   . In each query you are given 3 numbers l , r and x  , and the operation was to increment elements from indexes l to r by x . After all these operations you had to print the array . \\n\\n\\tSolution : Standard prefix sum question , maintain another array initialized by zero and for each query increment a_new[l] by x and decrease a_new[r + 1] by x  .After that calculate the prefix sum and add the elements to the original array .  \\n\\nHe told me to write the code in google doc and dry run it on a sample test case . \\n\\nFurther he modified the question by introducing queries of the second type (along with the first type )where we have to answer what is the value of a given index at that point  . \\n\\n\\tSolution : This can be done by range updates in segment trees . I told him that segment tree is quite a lengthy code to write so he  just told me to explain the concept  . So I explained how range updates are done through lazy propagation in  segment trees and how to get the value of the element by divide and conquer approach . \\n\\nHe was satisfied with the solution , and the interview lasted around 30 - 35 mins. \\n\\nRound 2 : \\n\\n\\tThis round was purely based on C ++ , OOPS , COA  and DBMS : \\n\\n\\tHe asked me a lot of questions .I’ll write which all i remember : \\n\\nDifference between struct and class ? (public and private)\\n\\nDifference between new and malloc ? (related to constructor calling)\\n\\nWhich is located above stack or heap ? (stack)\\n\\nAsked me about heapify algorithm  along with time complexity.\\n\\nTime complexity of addition (O(number of bits of the larger number)) .\\n\\nSame for multiplication. He asked about some Kasturba algo, which is a faster version , but I did not know about that .\\n\\nThen he asked about some DRAM question , which i do not remember exactly\\n\\nWhat is a write - back cache and write-through cache ?\\n\\nHe asked me one more COA question which I was not able to answer as it was not taught in our course.\\n\\nHe asked me about ACID properties in DBMS.\\n\\nOverall he seemed satisfied. It is okay not to know the answer for all questions but you should be confident in the topics of your strength . \\n\\nRound 3 : \"),\n",

It started with my intro , my projects , and my interests for 5 mins . then he asked some basic questions about C language like about struct , memory management , malloc , specifiers and role of volatile keyword in c language  , I said to him that i am more proficient in c++ , but he literally ignored and keep asking questions on c language    and then he asked to me code some questions like no, of trailing set bits in a number in c (** only c ) , be sure to check the syntax basics before the interview and then some puzzles like cutting a cake in 8 equal parts in 3 moves only and the second one was also a easy one then he moved to the dsa part and asked questions like difference between array and linked list , and then asked me to design  all the stack operations. I was able to code and then he asked some python questions which I was not able to answer and this was followed by some coa questions as well , i was able to answer some of them . Then he asked another string coding question to find if a string exists in another string or not . (again in c) i coded it in time , he seems satisfied   , he then asked some basic questions that why you want to work here an that are u really interested in embedded  system , i said i like the SDE  part in that and is okay to work in developing software based tools for them   then he seems happy and the interview got over and  also in the evening i received a call from hr regarding my location preferences \\n\\nVerdict - selected \\n\\nLakshmi Soujanya Kolasani  (Software )\\n\\nOnline test:\\n\\nMcq 90 min- 60 que (30 min 20 que each)\\n\\nAptitude\\n\\nProgramming basics (pointers ,error,output(c language))\\n\\nComputer science(os,coa)/communication/digital\\n\\nInterview \\n\\nThere was only one round of tech interview\\n\\nInterviewer was so cool\\n\\nHe started with tell me about yourself ,interests\\n\\nWhy do you want to join qualcomm ?\\n\\nHe then asked me about my projects ,courses and what ds u know to implement in c++ \\n\\nHe asked about linked lists and asked me to implement the insert,delete function with head and data given.

The interview began with exchanging greetings and following were these questions:\\n\\nA)    Tell me about yourself – You may fumble but it’s okay. Gather courage and complete your introduction.  Believe me, after this the ice really breaks and you are good to proceed with technical questions. The interviewer won’t judge you on this. This question is asked to make you more comfortable. Tell about your hobbies, \\n\\n\\n\\ninterests. In my case, one of my interests matched with that of interviewer. This made me much more confident.\\n\\nBe confident throughout and always have that smile on your face. Most of the times, the interviewers are very friendly and helpful. Ask for hints or problem clarification. Go with the mindset of discussing problems rather than mere coding it.\\n\\nB)     Find missing number from 1 to N - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-the-missing-number/\\n\\nC)     Find non-repeating element - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-element-appears-array-every-element-appears-twice/\\n\\nD)    Check for integer overflow - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-integer-overflow-multiplication/\\n\\nE)     Calculate memory used in union{ inti; char c[4]; }x; and struct x { inti; char c[4]; };\\n\\nF)     Find Pair with given sum - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/given-an-array-a-and-a-number-x-check-for-pair-in-a-with-sum-as-x/\\n\\nG)    Swap even and odd bits - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/swap-all-odd-and-even-bits/\\n\\nH)    Matrix multiplication - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/strassens-matrix-multiplication/\\n\\nThe interviewer expected me to provide the exact solution which is given in the GFG articles and I could tell him the correct approach. My interviewer did not want me to write code but to tell the exact optimized approach to solve the problem. Also, the interviewer expected me to have sound knowledge of bit manipulation and digital design fundamentals.\\n\\nThis was the only technical round and I got selected at the end.\\n\\n Verdict - selected  \\n\\nPrathamesh Pathak  (Hardware Profile) \\n\\nWritten Test (Online Exam) Test conducted on HirePro Platform. The exam consists of 3 sections, each having 20 questions, 30 minutes for each section. Section 1 was based on Quantitative Aptitude and data interpretation, majority problems from Probability, Simple Mathematics, Arrangement, blood relation, etc. Section 2 was based on Basic C programming, which contains fundamental problems from pointers, stacks, loops. Section 3 consists of Digital electronics. This section covers various topics like basic logic Gates, decoder, multiplexer, shift registers, function implementation using minimum NAND /NOR gates, ADC, and a few questions from computer architecture and Microprocessor.\\n\\nTechnical Round (Interview) It was a short round of 30-45 minutes only. The questions were based on the Resume and interests. They will ask questions about projects you have done. The interview consists of questions from Latch, flipflop, Setup time & hold time, FSM, Counters, Mealy, Moore Machines, and some puzzles. Also, tell the interviewer about topics you have not studied, like computer architecture, etc. Also, prepare for some analog topics like MOSFET, BJT, Current Mirrors, etc. Keep your communication skills good and communicate your approach. The Most Important is to be patient and calm\\n\\n. ● Resources to Prepare From 1. Digital Design by M. Morris Mano 2. Digital Design and computer architecture by Harris, David Money Harris 3. Puzzles from Interviewbit & GeeksforGeeks\\n\\n Verdict - selected  \\n\\nPrashant Pandey   (Hardware Profile) \\n\\n Written Test\\n\\n The written test of Qualcomm consisted of problems mainly from 5 broad subjects. The overall test duration was 90 minutes and the exam was video and audio proctored. There were questions based heavily on basic conceptual understanding of the C language, aptitude and logical reasoning, digital circuits, computer architecture and OS/DBMS. The key to cracking the written test is to focus on quality instead of quantity. Even if someone is able to solve questions only from 3/5 subjects, there is still a huge chance that they will get shortlisted for the interviews, provided they solved the attempted questions accurately. I \\n\\n\\n\\npersonally was able to solve questions only from C language, aptitude and logical reasoning and digital circuits. I submitted the exam with more than half of the questions unanswered. Hence, it is all about accuracy and not about attempting more problems than someone else, because practically thinking, the student giving the written test has just been introduced to the subjects of their branch. Hence, knowledge of all these fields is not expected. Become Master of some instead of Jack of all. Speed is also important for scoring well in the written test. Hence, practicing questions alongside studying/revising the concepts during the 2nd year or the sumer break is very important. \\n\\n2 Interview: \\n\\nQualcomm took only 1 round of interview this year. This was a very short round of 30 minutes only and comprised of both technical and HR based questions. The questions were based on the submitted Resume and interests. The key to cracking this round is to be patient and calm. Talk freely about your interests and do mention about a hardware project, if you have any. I had only 1 project based on FSM design, verilog coding and FPGA implementation. While talking about my interests I told the interviewer that I had done this project. Hence, we then talked a lot about the project, mainly about what concepts it was based on and how I implemented it. Also, be sure to tell the interviewer the things that you have not yet studied, for example computer architecture, or anything else. Also, make sure you tell the interviewer the topics you have studied, like for example static timing analysis, basic pipelining or anything else. The interviewer will then most certainly ask you 1 question on these topics and if you are able to answer, it is a win-win. Hence, it is same here as in the written test, it is all about quality and not quantity. It is not important to have knowledge of all the things. But, it is important to have knowledge about subjects you say you have studied. \\n\\n3 Resources to Study \\n\\n 3.1 Aptitude and Logical Reasoning\\n\\n• www.indiabix.com/aptitude/questions-and-answers/\\n\\n• www.interviewbit.com/puzzles/\\n\\n Make sure you solve at least a few problems from each topic.\\n\\n 3.2 C Programming Language  \\n\\nthe best source to study/revise this is from the book Brian W. Kernighan, Dennis M. Ritchie - The ANSI C Programming Language-Prentice Hall (1988). This book is written by the creators of the C \\n\\n\\n\\nlanguage, to teach the world C language for the first time ever. So there is everything in this concise book that is there in C language. I did not study this book in its entirety, but studying till Chapter 6 - Structures is a must. Practice C programming from Hackerrank. \\n\\n3.3 Digital Circuits \\n\\nFirst, study chapters 1 to 6 of the book M. Morris Mano, Michael D. Ciletti - Digital Design\\n\\n: With an Introduction to the Verilog HDL - Prentice Hall (2012). This book will cover all the basics of digital circuits. Make sure to practice at least all the starred problems (for which there are answers present at the end of the book so that you can match your answers after solving). After studying this, go through chapters 1 to 8 of MIT Computational Structures. Next, pick up the book Harris, David Money Harris, Sarah L - Digital design and computer architecture (2012 - 2015, Morgan Kaufmann Publishers) and study everything that seems new. You may skip the computer architecture part if there is less time. In case this book is not available, the book Jan M Rabaey, Anantha P Chandrakasan, Borivoje Nikolic, Assistant Professor - Digital Integrated Circuits - A Design Perspective - Pearson Education (2003) is also a great book to study from. If there is still time left on your hands, then consider doing chapters 7 and 8 from the book M. Morris Mano, Michael D. Ciletti - Digital Design: With an Introduction to the Verilog HDL - Prentice Hall (2012). This will give you an edge over the others. Some good NPTEL lectures are also present on this topic. nptel.ac.in/courses/106/105/106105165/ is a good course that can be followed to study Hardware Modelling Using Verilog. If there is still time left on your hands, then consider doing chapters 7 and 8 from the book M. Morris Mano, Michael D. Ciletti - Digital Design: With an Introduction to the Verilog HDL - Prentice Hall (2012). This will give you an edge over the others.\\n\\n3.4 Computer Architecture \\n\\nStudy the book Harris, David Money Harris, Sarah L - Digital design and computer architecture (2012 - 2015, Morgan Kaufmann Publishers) in its entirety. Study about microprocessors. Some good books for this are Ramesh S.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\DELL\\\\OneDrive\\\\Desktop\\\\genai1\\\\data\\\\Internship Interview Experiences\\\\Rubrik.docx'}, page_content='Rubrick interveiw questions and experiences\\n\\nAdittya Gupta\\n\\nI feel like the whole shortlisting procedure of Rubrik favors the person who has done a lot of competitive programming. Like I made very good projects and had a decent CPI but none of it matters if you can’t solve their algorithmic problem. Also their main focus was on questions based on graph theory. So be sure that you brush up your concepts on this topic.\\n\\nInterview consisted of two technical round followed by an HR round\\n\\nRound 1\\n\\nThe interview started with brief intro from both sides. My interviewer was an IITG alumni and was a candidate master on codeforces. He shared with me a link to some online coding platform where I have to code the solution and run on some test cases that they provide. The interface of the coding platform was very similar to that of leetcode and interviewbit etc. The question was as follows\\n\\nThere are N cities and M bidirectional routes each of length 1 between these cities. Now in one move you can change any bidirectional route to unidirectional with direction as you want. Now after performing this move zero or more times you have to tell whether it is possible that the resultant map has following property\\n\\nThere is no path whose length is greater than 1\\n\\nwhere the path is a sequence of cities (not necessarily distinct ). So A->B->A->C->D is a valid path of length 4 since each edge has length 1 unit.\\n\\nActually the phrasing of this problem initially was very poor because of which in the first 10-15 min I was very confused. Later he corrected the phrasing after which I came up with a logic within a minute and coded a solution within 5 min or so. It passed all the test cases that the interviewer had and he was satisfied with the solution. Although he tried to ask a follow up question which was to also tell which edges I would change and to which direction. But my implementation already covered it so it was just adding 2-3 lines to my code.\\n\\nAfter this he asked some questions based on the key courses taken that I wrote in my CV. He asked me about B+ trees and how data is stored in it. After this he asked what are ACID properties in any DBMS implementation. I answered this too which marked the conclusion of this round. The total time of the interview was around 30-35 min\\n\\nRound 2\\n\\nThe interview began with a brief intro. My interviewer was a very old IITG alumni and was at some senior position there. He asked me a very easy CP question and it was as follows\\n\\n\\n\\nYou are given an NxN grid of integers where each integer denotes the water level in that cell. You are currently at (1,1) and you need to reach (N,N). You start from (1,1) with some experience level X. You can go to some cell (i,j) if and only if X>=A[i][j]. Find minimum X so that you can reach (N,N) starting from (1,1)\\n\\nI came up with a solution within a minute and told the interviewer. He was satisfied with it then I later coded it in around 5 min or so and got all their test cases passed. They had no follow up question although, they insisted that there was one more syntax of writing binary search which many people use but it was not something big as my program also had the same complexity and correctness as theirs. After this they asked me if I had questions. I asked 2-3 questions about the company culture and their expectations from me etc. The whole interview concluded in about 20 mins.\\n\\nRound 3(HR)\\n\\nThe HR interview was based mostly on CV but they weren’t covering the technical part obviously. Like if there is some project that I mentioned in my CV, they were more interested in the non technical aspects of it. Like what was my major motivation and if it were a group project what problems I faced with my team? How did I solve these problems? They also looked at my PORs and asked me what all I did when I was at that position and difficulties etc related to it. I became so chill after my first two interviews that I told the HR that my most hated course is DSA 😜 and I don’t know what the company does 🙂. Please don’t be a fool like me, Rubrik has a past history of rejecting many candidates in HR interviews so it’s better to take it seriously.\\n\\nI was given the inter offer from Rubrik at the end.\\n\\nSoln to first ques : Observe that it is only possible if the original graph is bipartite\\n\\nSoln to second ques : Apply binary search on the answer while applying dfs to check if the final position is reachable or not in each step\\n\\nHarshit Seksaria\\n\\nTechnical Round 1\\n\\nThe interviewer introduced himself and asked me for an intro. After that, we directly move on to the question.\\n\\nQuestion: There are n cities, m bidirectional waterways connect them. We have to convert all bidirectional waterways to unidirectional waterways, in such a way that if a cruise start from any city, it should have either of the following properties -\\n\\nIt cannot leave that city.\\n\\nIt leaves the city and gets stuck in the very next city it arrives.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf such a transformation is possible, output that. Otherwise, report it is not possible.\\n\\nApproach: I started stating my observations as soon as I understood the problem.\\n\\nObservation 1 - If a city has any incoming waterways, it cannot have any outgoing waterways. I.e. it can only have incoming waterways.\\n\\nObservation 2 - If a city has any outgoing waterways, it cannot have any incoming waterways. I.e. it can only have outgoing waterways.\\n\\nIt is immediate from the above two observations that for every city, I have two options. Either make all of its edges outgoing or incoming. After a few seconds, I realized the problem boils down to whether the graph is bipartite. Interviewer was satisfied with my reasoning and explanation and thus asked me to code it. I quickly implemented the code using DFS, and ran the test case given by interviewer, it worked in the first go.\\n\\nInterviewer was visibly happy with my explanation and code, and told me everything was perfect. We still had 15 minutes left after that, he asked me if I had any questions for him. We talked about his work, what he does, etc, for a good 15 minutes.\\n\\nTechnical Round 2\\n\\nThe interviewer was a recent graduate from IIT Guwahati. He was from Barak, and I am from Umiam, so we had a laugh about that. We moved to the question just after that.\\n\\nQuestion: Given an array A of N integers, if you are at index i, you can jump to any index from (i+1) to (i+A[i]) in one move. Starting from i=1, find the minimum number of moves to reach i=N.\\n\\nConstraint: N <= 1e5\\n\\nI quickly proposed an O(NlogN) solution, using DP and segment tree. Interviewer told me that there exists an O(N) solution, but then he asked me to implement segment tree if I was comfortable with it as O(NlogN) was good enough for him.\\n\\nO(NlogN) approach: dp(i) represents the minimum number of moves required to move from i to N. Base case: dp(N) = 0. Transition: dp(i) = 1 + min dp(j), where i+1 <= j <= i+A[i]. Use segment tree for RMQ.\\n\\nI implemented the above approach and tried running a sample test case. It resulted in a segmentation fault. I panicked a little bit as I claimed to be comfortable with implementing segment tree. But after a minute or two, I found the mistake and then it worked on the sample test case. Interviewer gave me another two test cases, and they passed.\\n\\nFollow-Up 1: Now the elements of the array A can be negative or 0.\\n\\nApproach: A few changes in transition are required, if A[i] <= 0, then dp(i) = INT_MIN.\\n\\n\\n\\nFollow-Up 2: As we still had a lot of time left, interviewer asked me if I could come up with the O(N) approach now.\\n\\nAfter a few minutes, I came up with the following approach -\\n\\nO(N) approach: Start with i=1, we know that we can go to any of {2, 3, …, 1+A[1]} positions in one move. Now find the maximum of j+A[j], where 2 <= j <= 1+A[1]. We can do that in one traversal from 2 to 1+A[1]. Let that maximum be M. Now, we know that we can go to any of {2+A[1], …, M} positions in two moves. Repeat the process until position N is covered.\\n\\nInterviewer was satisfied with my approach.\\n\\nFollow-Up 3: Instead of an array, now we have a matrix A of size NxM. At position (i, j), we can move to any position between (i+1, j) and (i+A[i][j], j) or between (i, j+1) and (i, j+A[i][j]) in one move. Find the minimum number of moves to reach (N, M) from (1, 1).\\n\\nBefore I could think of anything significant, we ran out of time. Interviewer tried explaining the approach briefly, but I couldn’t understand because tired.\\n\\nHR Round\\n\\nHR Round was very chill, it was just like a normal conversation. We talked about my projects, PORs, and internship. She saw that I’d won a silver medal in Spardha Chess, and decided to mention that her 6 y/o son has started playing chess, we talked about starting chess at a young age. She asked about my motivation for competitive programming, and one thing that it has taught me - I squeezed in one of Rubrik’s RIVET values here - Relentlessness. I could notice an instant glow on her face as soon as I mentioned that.\\n\\nTips\\n\\nRubrik’s interviews have a fixed format. They don’t talk about your resume, DSA, OOP, DBMS, or anything in technical rounds. It is just one CP question per round. You have to implement that and pass the test cases.\\n\\nFor confidence, think of it in this way. You are given one CP question and you have 45 minutes to come up with the solution code AND you have one person who is going to help you throughout.\\n\\nThink out loud - The interviewer wants you to reach the solution approach eventually, if you keep putting your thoughts in words, they will be able to point you in the right direction. Anything the interviewer says can be a hint, look out.\\n\\nFor the HR Round, go through Rubrik’s RIVET values and try to include them in your answers.\\n\\nAasneh Prasad\\n\\nCoding Round :\\n\\n4 coding Questions – 1hr time limit.\\n\\nQ1) and Q2) were on Binary Search.\\n\\nQ3) was on constructive algorithm.\\n\\nQ4) was on Number Theory.\\n\\nInterview Round 1 (Technical & Online):\\n\\nThe round started off with some brief introduction and we directly jumped to the problem:\\n\\nGiven N cities and M bidirectional waterways between cities, you are given a task to change the waterways from bidirectional to unidirectional in such a way that a cruise can depart from nor more than once when it has already departed in a path when departing from any of the N cities if the city has any outgoing waterways. If impossible inform it.\\n\\nConstraints : N<=1e5, M<=min(1e5,(N*(N-1))/2)\\n\\nApproach: The initial observations I be made were:\\n\\n1)If I start from a city I should be able to reach it from any other city à Departing city have no incoming edges.\\n\\n2) If I enter a city from some other city I should not be able to depart from it à Arrival City should have no outgoing edges.\\n\\n3) A Departing City must be connected to only an Arrival City.\\n\\nAll these observations easily showed that this problem is of Bipartite Graphs. We just had to see if the graph is 2 colourable or not. If there is any odd cycle à we cannot colour it with 2 colours. Time Complexity is just O(N+M) as we just have to perform a simple DFS and assign appropriate colours to each node. I had to code up the solution on the IDE link provided to me.\\n\\nInterview Round 2 (Technical & Online):\\n\\n\\n\\nThe round started off with some brief introduction and we directly jumped to the problem:\\n\\nYou are given a NxN grid with depth[i][j] à depth of swimming pool at (i,j). From a point on the grid you can move to it’s adjacent neighbours (provided you don’t go out of the grid). You can swim at extremely high speeds (taking 0s to swim across a swimming pool), However to enter a pool at (i,j) the time you spent inside the grid must be >= the depth[i][j]. For example:\\n\\nLet T à current time spent in grid. Imagine you are at (i,j) and you want to go to (i+1,j).\\n\\nIf(T>=depth[i+1][j]){\\n\\n// No change in T and you can directly go to (i+1,j).\\n\\n}\\n\\nElse{\\n\\nT=depth[i+1][j].\\n\\n}\\n\\nFind the Minimum Time required to reach the point (N,M).\\n\\nConstraints: N<=50, 0<=Depth[i][j]<=N*N for all 1<=i<=N, 1<=j<=N.\\n\\nApproach: I took sometime to understand the question. I asked him a lot of questions and details about the problem. Remember to be vocal if you don’t understand the question or some part of it. Then I proposed a solution using priority queue/ multiset was similar in some sense to Dijkstra’s Algorithm for shortest path. Maintain a 2-D NxN array where time[i][j] denotes the shortest to reach (i,j) from (1,1).Time[1][1]=Depth[1][1] and Initially push <Time[1][1],(1,1)> in the multiset. Pop the top/smallest element (Time-wise) denoted by (i,j) and Check for it’s neighbours (x,y) if they are unvisited or their Time[x][y]>Time[i][j], then push it into the multiset. This way we’ll get the required answer. The time Complexity will be O(N^2logN) similar to Dijkstra. He was satisfied with the approach and asked me to code it up. We fell short on time and I couldn’t code up the whole solution, however he said he was happy with the approach. He was an IITG alumni and we talked a bit about college. At the end he asked me if I there is another approach possible to solve this problem. It struck me Binary Search is a way simpler solution. We ended the interview on that note.\\n\\nInterview Round 3 (HR & Offline):\\n\\nShe scanned through my CV. Asked me how my projects were useful and a few things about myself such as What made you do CP, Where do you see yourself in 5 yrs etc. She talked about Rubrik’s RIVET principles and the work culture there.\\n\\n\\n\\nNote: Never take any HR round lightly as we don’t know what all a company is looking for. 4 of us got to the HR round and let me be blunt and say that I got rejected in the HR round so *DO NOT TAKE ANY HR ROUND LIGHTLY PLS*.\\n\\nRubrick interveiw questions and experiences 2022\\n\\nGunjan Dhanuka\\n\\nCoding Test: 4 questions. The first was very easy, and the second was moderate. The third was tough. The fourth question was very long and most of us skipped it, but it was fairly easy and one guy did it and got shortlisted for the next round. Questions based on graphs and mathematics.\\n\\nInterview Round 1 (take 1)\\n\\nA Zoom call was scheduled and the interviewer proceeded to give the question after exchanging greetings. \\n\\nQuestion: There is a n x m grid and there are three types of cells: with cheese, with an obstacle or empty. If a cell has an obstacle the mouse cannot pass through it. Return the coordinate of the cell from which the mouse has to travel the least total Manhattan distance to eat all the cheese blocks. After he eats one cheese block, he comes back to the cell and then leaves again.\\n\\nAnswer: use multi-source BFS from all the cells containing cheese blocks and add the distances for each cell. This way each cell’s value will indicate the total number of steps in one direction the mouse has to take from that cell to all cheese blocks. Return the cell with the minimum value. (Make sure to check that you do not go through obstacles)\\n\\n(However I was facing internet problems that evening, and neither the hostel LAN nor my mobile data was working properly. Due to repeated connection drops, we had to reschedule the meeting before I could write the code).\\n\\nInterview Round 1 (take 2)\\n\\nThe interviewer was different this time, with a different question ofcourse. It was more difficult than the first one. So the question is something like this.He gave me the link to some CodePair like platform where he can see my code and pasted the question there.\\n\\nQuestion: Given a list of caps each with a color value and a cost value. Also we are given two constants - X and Y. Now we can swap the positions of two caps in the list based on two conditions:\\n\\nIf they are of the same color, then cost[i] + cost[j] < X\\n\\nIf they are of different colors, then cost[i] + cost[j] < Y\\n\\nFind out the number of permutations of the caps possible if we can swap any number of times (possibly 0). The caps of the same color are also considered to be different.\\n\\n\\n\\nHint: Consider first only the caps of the same color. Then find out the pairs which can be swapped with each other, and see how you can calculate the permutations possible.\\n\\nConsider the following 10 values,\\n\\nX = 30\\n\\nY = 20\\n\\nColor R B R G R B B R R B Cost 10 20 5 20 20 10 10 15 20 10 Position 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\\n\\nAnswer: Let us consider the following example and consider only the combinations of the same color.\\n\\nThen the ordered pairs which are swappable are:\\n\\n(1,3), (1,7), (1,8), (3,5), (3,8), (3,9) and so on. Now taking each position as a node, construct a graph with the edges as obtained from the above ordered pairs. Now it is possible to swap all the nodes within a connected component with each other in some number of moves. (Try to draw a few examples to test this out). So now just find out the number of connected components and the number of nodes within a connected component. Solve further for the case of different colours too.\\n\\nSo I was able to suggest this solution after some discussion with the interviewer and then wrote the code. He ran some test cases and they passed successfully so my interview ended there. The interview focussed only on solving the question provided and nothing about projects, technical skills, etc.\\n\\nInterview Round 2\\n\\nDuring the second round, the interviewer first introduced himself and asked me to introduce myself. It was a unique coincidence that the interviewer was an alumni of IIT Guwahati, and had been an ex-Secretary of Coding Club ( and I was the current Secretary of the Coding Club). So we had some discussion about the activities of the club and how it has grown since his days. \\n\\nThen we moved on to the question. So he started with a very basic question and started increasing the difficulty bit by bit.\\n\\nQuestion: Given a linked list of n nodes, and an ant is on the 1st node. It moves one step on every time step. After t tends to infinity, what will be the probability of the ant being at a particular node?\\n\\nAnswer: I asked first of all that is it a singly linked list or a doubly linked list. Then I asked if it can have loops in the linked list (he replied no for this question). It is very important to ask the right questions in an interview and complimented me for the questions. So the answer is the nth node will have probability 1 while all other nodes have 0.\\n\\nQuestion: Suppose that the linked list is circular (i.e. the last node points to the first node again). What is the probability of the ant being in a certain node (at time tends to infinity)?\\n\\nAnswer: Since now each node is equally likely to be visited, the probability of each node is 1/n\\n\\nQuestion: Now the loop is not at the end, but suppose at the mth node. So at the mth node, the ant has two options - either to break out of the loop or go back into the loop. What is the probability distribution?\\n\\nAnswer: When the ant is at the mth node, it has 0.5 probab of staying in the node and 0.5 of staying out of it. So at time infinity, the probability of all m nodes inside the loop should be equal and in parts of 0.5. So 1/(2*m) for the nodes in the loop, 0.5 for the last node and 0 for all others.\\n\\nNow he moved on to the real question. He gave a binary tree and said that if the ant is at the root at t=0, then where will it be after time t?\\n\\nHe followed up by giving the same question with a general tree and then proceeded to ask for a Directed Acyclic Graph. The question was the same but now we had the starting node from where he had to find all the probabilities.\\n\\nAnswer: We need to perform topological sorting to get an ordering of the nodes and then we can predict the order in which the ant would visit them. \\nThe time was over so I couldn’t finish the code but had explained the idea completely. \\n\\nHR Round\\n\\nThe interviewer was very experienced and he was the one who gave the pre-internship talk for Rubrik. We exchanged introductions and then he proceeded to ask me some questions regarding my previous projects. He made me very comfortable with the situation and was very friendly. \\n\\nSome of the questions he asked:\\n\\nWhere do you see yourself 5 or 10 years down the line?\\n\\nWill you go for higher studies? – I said that I would like to pursue masters in the future but not immediately after BTech 🙂\\n\\nTell one project which was challenging for you and where you worked as a group. – Inter IIT Bosch High Prep\\n\\nWhat were the challenges you faced and what did you learn from your peers?\\n\\nWhat do you believe your peers learnt from you?\\n\\nThe discussion lasted for a good amount of time, and it was really fun and relaxing talking to him.\\n\\nSome Tips for Rubrik Interviews:\\n\\n\\n\\nRubrik is known for asking “very tough” CP questions so a lot of people (including me) get demotivated even before applying to Rubrik.\\n\\nBe calm and try to listen to the question carefully and work your way through small test cases.\\n\\nThe interviewers are very helpful, and would generally lend a few hints if you are really stuck or can push you in the right direction.\\n\\nPrepare some standard personality based questions so that you don’t spend a lot of time in the interview thinking about the answers.'),\n",

He asked me about garbage collectors and differences between python and cpp. Later he asked me to implement a random access iterator and bidirectional iterator. Interviewer was rather strict and was trying to test the basics and implementation knowledge of the programming languages.\\n\\nRound 2 - Technical :\\n\\n2nd round was simple. It was mostly about problem solving and system design.\\n\\n1st que was regarding system design. He asked me to implement a movie booking system like book my show. He asked me to prepare relevant models and the associated functions which would be involved in the booking system. Interviewer was chill. He was trying to help me whenever I got stuck. The key point is to think out loud and interact with the interviewer.\\n\\n2nd que was a medium level cp que. It was to create a deep clone of a linked list with a random pointer.  Link\\n\\nRound 3 - HR :\\n\\nHr round was normal. Some typical hr ques and some ques regarding my projects were asked.\\n\\nLovish Agarwal : selected\\n\\nRound 1 - Technical :\\n\\nInterview went around Linked List. I was asked to clone a singly linked list, I explained the logic to the Interviewer then was able to code it in 10 min.\\n\\nThen he asked to clone a doubly linked list. He then extended the question, in place of previous pointer in doubly linked list he changed that to random pointer which pointed to random node.\\n\\n\\n\\nI solved the question using map, then he asked to optimize space. I was facing difficulty solving that, he gave some hints for the same then I was able to solve the question.\\n\\nIt was an easy round and the interviewer was very friendly.\\n\\nRound 2 - Technical :\\n\\nFirst, I was asked to solve a question on prefix/suffix array. Then he asked to implement a class for a Chess game (I was told to tell high level details only).\\n\\nI used all 4 pillars of OOPS for the same.\\n\\nThen he asked basic question on DBMS - Difference between Candidate Key and Primary Key. What is DDL and DML?\\n\\nRound 3 - HR :\\n\\nInterviewer was in a high position like Manager or so. He asked about my experience in college and college life so far. He asked everything from my resume, from projects to courses.\\n\\nHe asked what was taught in this course and also asked questions in depth for the topics which I told.\\n\\nI said DP, greedy in Design and Analysis of Algorithms, he asked me to explain these topics and give examples as well.\\n\\nHe asked in depth questions from the projects as well like how many APIs were created, what were those APIs, why you used MongoDB. Then he asked how data is stored in MongoDB vs SQL.\\n\\nThen he asked why you wanted to join the company and standard HR questions.\\n\\nGanji Pala Venki Reddy : selected\\n\\nRound 1: (Technical Round )\\n\\nInitially he asked to introduce myself. Then he asked about some basics in oops. Then he moved onto the coding part. He gave a question as follows :\\n\\nThere is a one-dimensional garden of length N. \\n\\nIn each position of the N length garden, a fountain has been installed. Given an array a[] such that a[i] describes the coverage limit of i-th fountain.\\n\\nA fountain can cover the range from the position max(i – a[i], 1) to min(i + a[i], N). In the beginning, all the fountains are switched off. \\n\\nThe task is to find the minimum number of fountains needed to be activated such that the whole N-length garden can be covered by water.\\n\\nInput: a[] = {1, 2, 1} \\n\\n\\n\\nOutput: 1 \\n\\nExplanation: \\n\\nFor position 1: a[1] = 1, range = 1 to 2 \\n\\nFor position 2: a[2] = 2, range = 1 to 3 \\n\\nFor position 3: a[3] = 1, range = 2 to 3 \\n\\nTherefore, the fountain at position a[2] covers the whole garden. Therefore, the required output is 1.\\n\\nI solved it using Dynamic programming.\\n\\nRound 2: (Technical Round)\\n\\nHe started with computer Fundamentals like what is meant by Virtual Function and Function Overloading. Then he asked a coding question.\\n\\nI didn’t remember exact question But it is similar to, \\n\\nGiven a string, a partitioning of the string is a palindrome partitioning if every substring of the partition is a palindrome. For example, “aba|b|bbabb|a|b|aba” is a palindrome partitioning of “ababbbabbababa”. Determine the fewest cuts needed for a palindrome partitioning of a given string. For example, minimum of 3 cuts are needed for “ababbbabbababa”. The three cuts are “a|babbbab|b|ababa”. If a string is a palindrome, then minimum 0 cuts are needed. If a string of length n contains all different characters, then minimum n-1 cuts are needed.\\n\\nInput : str = “geek” \\n\\nOutput : 2\\n\\nWe need to make minimum 2 cuts, i.e., “g ee k”\\n\\nAt last he asked me about Polymorphism in oops and some basic questions in Databases.\\n\\nRound 3: (HR Round)\\n\\nIt started with my introduction. Then He asked me to explain about one of my projects and asked a few questions on my project. Then he asked normal questions about the salesforce company. Interviewer was so chill.\\n\\nHimanshi Gautam (Women in Tech)\\n\\nWe received this mail from CCD around 20th June regarding this internship opportunity for female students at Salesforce. There was a virtual event, PPT followed by coding test and interviews, both eliminatory in nature.\\n\\nThe coding round had three questions, one was implementation based, one was based on number theory, and one was was based on binary search.\\n\\n\\n\\nRound 1\\n\\nAfter this, the shortlisted candidates had an online technical interview. In the technical interview, they asked some basic OOPs topics like encapsulation, abstraction, and their real life applications. Then they moved on to ask a little about my project and the tech stack used, after which they moved onto DSA. They asked me two DSA questions, both easy-medium leetcode level. The first one was given a list of strings having two length each, you have to output the length of the longest palindromic string that can be generated using those strings. I was able to solve it in O(nlogn) time and O(n) space using maps. The second one was given an array of integers, you have to find the length of the largest subarray that shares the degree of the array. Degree here being the number of occurrences of the maximum occuring element in the array. Similarly, I was able to solve it with O(n) space and O(nlogn) time.\\n\\nRound 2\\n\\nThe second interview was an HR round. The interview asked me to explain my most favourite project and to go through its flow, asking how some feature is functioning the way it is, some questions regarding the tech stack used, how the database schema is designed, how the multiple clients are being handled and so on. Then he moved onto some behavioural questions like, how was it leading a team project, working with different types of people, what challenges I faced, what innovative ideas and solutions I came up with, how was it as an experience and so on. The HR was very nice, and yes, he was a React guy. Some HR do know tech stacks :)\\n\\nParth Kasture \\n\\nThe whole process involved Coding Round and 2 interviews (Technical + HR). Coding round was more or less formality and shortlisting was done on the basis of CPI (16 people were shortlisted for interviews). \\n\\nTechnical Round: \\n\\nThere were 2 interviewers and one of them was working in the field of Security. He first took a look into my CV and as I had mentioned password encryption and file sharing, he started asking \\n\\n\\n\\nquestions about them. He asked me how and why I implemented password encryption, all about salt and pepper and went deeper and deeper. We talked about it for almost 10 mins. Then he asked me about file sharing and how I implemented it. After I explained my approach, he asked me how to restrict anyone with a link to open the file and only the required person to open it. As I could not answer he asked me what my approach would be and again this involved discussion of 10 – 15 min. He also asked me about how Torrent works (I didn’t know).  \\n\\nAs not much time was left, the other interviewer interrupted and asked some basic OOPs questions like about class, objects, types of polymorphism, overloading, overriding, interfaces and so on. Also asked a few DBMS questions like ACID properties and other basic things. He then asked me to implement a simple parking lot system using appropriate data structure where cars come, take a token and park in the corresponding slot and when they leave, they return the token. I started with a basic approach and then later optimized to use queue. \\n\\nThey then asked me whether I had any questions. I asked the first interviewer about the thing (BLOB structure) which he had mentioned in the midst, and I didn’t know about it. I asked about how Netflix implements its account sharing and a lot more questions which I felt relevant to the interview. At the end the interviewer told me that he liked my curiosity, and I got a call for the second interview. \\n\\nHR Round: \\n\\n5 people had HR rounds out of which 4 got the offer. \\n\\nThis round was taken by one of the managers and was a very chill round and involved general discussion. I was asked what you know about Salesforce, why do you want to join. There was general discussion about my background, what my mother and father do, how my schooling was and other things. Then he asked which professor I liked the most and why :(, my favorite course in college and so on. He then asked me some behavioral questions, asked me to tell in what ways I was humorous (what was this question??) and what movies do I watch, what TV shows I watch. He also asked me about my minor (DSAI), what I was taught till now in that. \\n\\nB Vijesh R Bhat\\n\\nThe coding round was somewhat hard I would say since I don’t exactly remember the questions asked. Many people could solve all the questions(3) in that round and the final shortlisting was based on CPI among CSE and MnC students. I was shortlisted for the interviews after this round.\\n\\nTechnical Interview Round:\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was a single Tech Round and then it was HR. This interview took 1 hr. and was scheduled immediately after I had completed the 3 rounds of Oracle Interviews (Pretty hectic day). There were two interviewers, a young lady and a man. The lady started by asking me to write the code on paper, a standard sliding window question, the link of which is here below: https://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-window-maximum/\\n\\nI answered it correctly, but I used a few extra variables and wasn’t able to remove them when she demanded me to. Even though the space still remained the same (was just using some constant space more), she didn’t budge. She wasn’t ready to accept even the slightest of deviations from the original Leetcode solution. Time ran out with me trying to optimize it. The other interviewer grilled me on databases. I had a project that used MongoDB (marked as Elementary proficiency) on my CV and he asked me all about NoSQL databases of which I didn’t have the slightest of Idea about. He then asked me about the fundamentals of OOPS and the real-life application of the 4 pillars of OOPS. I was able to answer this. They then wished me the best of luck for future endeavors and ended the Interview. Honestly speaking, the Interviewers were visibly disappointed at the end and neither did I have any energy left as I had a whole day of Interviews already. I wasn’t called for further rounds (HR Round).\\n\\nHimangshu Deka\\n\\nThere were a total of two rounds, the first was technical, and the second, was HR.\\n\\nTechnical Interview Round:\\n\\nI was asked two questions, with code to be written on paper and with a dry run as well. The first question was regarding the simple dp question where we are supposed to select the maximum sum of an array subject to the constraint that adjacent elements weren't to be picked, The one caveat was that they wanted both the dp approaches (top-down, and memoization) as well as \\n\\n\\n\\nan O(1) solution which I gave. Then the second question was to group the anagrams from a given vector of strings, I provided a soln using O(N) auxiliary space using a map of vectors, and he asked me what other data structure could be used, I also gave him a trie-based solution as well. He also asked me about the STL sort function.\\n\\nHR Round: \\n\\nI was asked about my favorite data structure, my dream company, what I knew about Salesforce, what I learned in the PPT, where I lived, and other HR questions.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\DELL\\\\OneDrive\\\\Desktop\\\\genai1\\\\data\\\\Internship Interview Experiences\\\\Sprinklr.docx'}, page_content=\"Sprinkler interveiw questions and experiences \\n\\nDivyam:-\\n\\nRound 1 -\\n\\nThe interviewer first asked me about my projects and experience. \\n\\nThen he gave a coding problem - Given n intervals, with each interval having a score related with it, choose k non overlapping intervals with the maximum sum of scores.\\n\\nI solved and coded it using dp and binary search. Dp[n][k] for keeping track of intervals selected and intervals visited. I also sorted intervals by their right endpoint. Binary search is used in dp for finding the interval with max right endpoint having value less than current interval’s left point. \\n\\nRound 2 -\\n\\nAsked me about the difference between Python and C++. Told about dynamic variables in Python v/s static variables in C++. Also Python uses interpreter and C++ is precompiled.\\n\\nGave me a question related to pointers, where I had to swap values at two double pointers.\\n\\nAt the end, he asked me to implement LRU policy using OOPS concept, similar to what we did in DBMS project. \\n\\nVineet:-\\n\\nFirst round was CP based, second round was CV based (also probably the team you get in your internship) and third round was HR (formality), some people had 3 technical rounds.\\n\\nRound1: Interviewer was helpful and asked moderately difficult cp questions.\\n\\nGiven a binary tree, find the width of the tree, defined as the maximum number of nodes in any level with different x-coordinates. (assuming root 0, right move +1, left move -1).\\n\\nGiven an array, find the lexicographically smallest array possible by swapping adjacent elements with different parity. Gave an O(n2) solution but the interviewer helped a lot and finally got an O(n) solution.\\n\\nA common graph question based on dijkstra. (https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/useful-extra-edges/) same question but with undirected edges.\\n\\n\\n\\nRound2: First I got an interviewer from the product team but when I told I am interested in ML, an interviewer from ML team was arranged. Had some good discussion on my ML & DL based projects, so be prepared and truthful (really helps) of what you have done. And then some theoretical questions on CV and random forests (since they were part of my projects). One of my projects also involved NLP but because I mentioned that I haven’t studied NLP thoroughly he didn’t ask any questions from that.\\n\\nRound3(HR): Short interview, standard HR questions, was basically a formality.\\n\\nVarenyam:-\\n\\nTechnical Round 1 : \\n\\nThere were two interviewers.\\n\\nDesign a song playlist with four functions:\\n\\nAdd song\\n\\nDelete song\\n\\nEdit song\\n\\nGet random song (a function returning random number from 0 to 1 was provided)\\n\\nUsed an unordered map and array. Stored indices of the song in unordered_map and swapped the song from the last song before deleting. \\n\\nGiven an array of numbers, two players take turns to choose numbers from either end. The player having maximum sum wins. Tell which player will win. The array is of even length and the sum of all elements is odd.\\n\\nYou are given a tree with no weights on edges and a number W. So you have to divide the number among the edges, such that the maximum distance between any two leaf nodes is the minimum possible. You can divide the number in fraction also.\\n\\nEg. if tree is \\n\\n1-> 2, 3, 4\\n\\nW = 3\\n\\nWe divide the number as \\n\\n1-2 -> 1\\n\\n1-3 -> 1\\n\\n1-4 -> 1\\n\\nSum of maximum distance 2\\n\\nBut if we divide as\\n\\n1-2 -> 2\\n\\n\\n\\n1-3 -> 1\\n\\nSum of maximum distance 3\\n\\nIn continuation of question 2. Now you also have to tell the score each player can get if both play optimally. (Use Mini-max algorithm).\\n\\nTechnical Round 2: \\n\\nGiven a tunnel open at one end and balls with different speeds moving towards the open end. If two balls collide then they form a single ball and the speed of the new ball is the minimum of the speed of colliding balls. You are given the speed of each ball and its corresponding distance from the open end. Find the number of balls that will reach the open end.\\n\\nGiven an array with only one max element. Find the number of permutations of the array such that in each permutation elements to the left of max element are in strictly increasing order and elements to the right are in strictly decreasing order. I came up with a simple backtracking solution but the interviewer wanted me to further optimize it.\\n\\nI had to write code for each problem which was tested against sample test cases. Completed the first one but could not complete the second one.\\n\\nTechnical Round 3:\\n\\nMy previous two interviews were not team-based but this time my interviewer was director manager of ML/AI team and asked me some ML questions related to my projects. Then he gave me 4 questions ( two puzzles and two coding questions). I only had to tell my approach and write pseudocode where necessary.\\n\\nBoth the coding questions were exact copies from interview bit. \\n\\nSum of pairwise hamming distance\\n\\nPoints on straight line\\n\\nOne puzzle was very basic. Other was using a die generate random numbers from 1 to 7. (hint : use binary representation)\\n\\nAt the end we had some discussions regarding future of ml and he also shared me some resources seeing my interest in the field.\\n\\nHR Round:\\n\\nThis was just a formality. Some basic hr questions were asked. Do some research about the company like its products and some success stories. HR wants to see your \\n\\n\\n\\ninterest in the company. Ask about the work culture and projects you would be working on.\\n\\nGitanjit:-\\n\\nInterview 1 (Tech)\\n\\nResume was discussed briefly. Interviewer asked me to explain each of my projects briefly.\\n\\nAsked to draw the database schema(on google jamboard) of one of my projects ( and some basic database theoretical questions follow up based on my schema)\\n\\nI had an ML project as well which we discussed for a while (challenges, data collection, whether I was satisfied / any further improvements i could think of, some basic ml theoretical questions followed like precision-recall, model-evaluation methods etc)\\n\\nCoding question 1(had to first explain logic and then code on google doc and dry run on testcases of my choice). Question - in a given binary tree print all the left leaf nodes which are visible in a right side view of the tree.https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-right-side-view/ link is only for right view ; just add a recrursive  function to print only the left leaf nodes.\\n\\nCoding question 2(had to first explain logic and then code on google doc and dry run on testcases of my choice). Question - Add two numbers given as linked lists and return the sum as linked list(no extra space and modification to list).\\n\\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sum-of-two-linked-lists/\\n\\nProbability question - Bobo the amoeba has a 25%, 25%, and 50% chance of producing 0, 1, or 2 offspring, respectively. Each of Bobo's descendants also have the same probabilities. What is the probability that Bobo's lineage dies out?\\n\\nAsked me to briefly explain all the maths courses I have done in college and select one topic from any course and give a real life application of it and mathematically justify it as well. Follow up question on that topic was asked as well.\\n\\nInterview 2 (Tech)\\n\\nCoding question 1(had to first explain logic and then code on google doc and dry run on testcases of my choice) A manager array is given for n employees i.e. parent of ith employee is manager[i] . Each employee has a response time given in time array. Find the total time taken to deliver a message to all the employees(starting from the main boss whose manager[i] value is -1.) Follow up question on how my code and complexities would change if the employees were sorted in topological order by index.\\n\\nCoding question 1(only logic was discussed didnt have to write code)\\n\\n\\n\\nDesign a system (like flipkart/amazon) which should be able to login and logout users and should be able to perform queries of the form ti which should either return a list of users or the number of  logged in/present in the system for the past ti time units.\\n\\nFirst i had to solve for a fixed ti and later generalise. I began with o(n) time soln, went to o(logn) time soln next. He wanted o(1) time queries. I got an o(1) solution but compromised on the space. He wanted o(1) time for each query and o(n) space which after a bit of discussion with him I ended up giving.\\n\\nHe asked me to explain any and all ML experience I have . I showed him all the projects(some were in extracurricular section of my cv and some weren't even in my cv ).\\n\\nI had worked on a project based on a research paper which he happened to use himself in his work , so  an extensive discussion was done based on the paper.\\n\\nInterview 3(Tech)\\n\\nHe asked me to give a 5min intro and said that my intro will decide what kind of questions will be asked in the interview.\\n\\nI was asked to open the code of my ml project . He asked questions based on almost each line of my project (cnn, gradient descent, binary crossentropy, ‘same’ padding, adam optimiser, some standard deeplearning questions,activation functions etc).\\n\\nSql queries mostly based on joins. Asked me to solve it separately with all kind of joins i knew and analyse which one was most optimal.\\n\\nProbability question1-https://www.quora.com/Can-you-solve-this-In-a-country-where-everyone-wants-a-boy-each-family-continues-having-babies-until-they-have-a-boy-What-is-the-proportion-of-boys-to-girls-in-the-country-if-the-probability-of-having-a-boy-or-a\\n\\nProbabilty question 2-\\n\\nDevise a strategy for player 1. Game: a deck of cards face down is given . player 2 keeps flipping cards taking the topmost card each time . player 1 can say stop at any card . That card will be the last card to be drawn .i.e. If he says stop in the beginning of the game only on card was drawn . I the cards remained unflipped in the card has more red cards you win . When should player 1 say stop and what is the probability of winning in that strategy.\\n\\nI came up with strategy but the probability was impossible to calculate manually(had to sum 52 fractions :( but just showing that it was more than ½ mathematically was enough)\\n\\nInterview 4 (HR or as they called it- Culture & Talent round)\\n\\n\\n\\nTotally chill round. Just had to know about what work the company does. Discussed hobbies, interests, preferred work environments etc . Was just a normal conversation rather than an interview.\\n\\nNote: At the end of Each round, they asked whether i have any question… Its preferable to have a good question ready for the interviewer. Also even if you dont know the answer discuss your approach with interviewer , dont let there be an awkward silence.\\n\\nExpect the interviewer to know everything about the tech you have used in your projects so be ready for a proper grilling based on any project you have , or maybe even anything at all you mention on your cv. Maybe try practising coding in google doc as well before a sprinklr interview(even in 2020 google doc coding was done in sprinklr).\\n\\nAditya Trivedi:-\\n\\nApart from questions mentioned here, I was asked to introduce myself, discuss any 1 of my projects and some OOPS questions. All rounds were roughly ~1 hour long\\n\\nTechnical Round #1\\n\\nGiven head pointers of two linked lists, find out their intersection point and return it, if they don’t intersect then return NULL pointer.\\n\\nDetect a cycle in a linked list and return that node. If there is not a cycle return NULL.\\n\\nGiven head pointers of two linked lists which may or may not have a cycle, find their intersection point, it is guaranteed that the intersection point will be before the cycle starts.\\n\\n\\tWrote code for above 3 cases, modifying same code question to question.\\n\\nWhat if the intersection point is in the cycle?\\n\\n\\tDidn’t have to implement the code for q4, only discussed.\\n\\nTechnical Round #2\\n\\nGiven a hard disk containing 3 types of memory- free space, filled space, corrupted space. Rearrange the memory to make it most efficient.\\n\\n\\n\\nClarified the question - making most efficient means bringing all free space together, filled space together and corrupted together\\n\\nIt was actually this question : In an array having 0s, 1s, 2s. Make all 0s together then 1s and then 2s.\\n\\n// [1, 0, 2, 0, 1, 2]\\n\\n// [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]\\n\\nCan’t “sort”. Can’t count 0s, 1s and 2s and actually write them in the array. Need to do swaps as they have some data filled in them. Two pointer approach worked.\\n\\nWe have a set of valid words and a set of characters. We have to construct the largest valid word using given characters. Discussed various approaches, where to store valid words - set, trie, etc. How to generate all possible words from our set of characters, etc.\\n\\nOOPS question on Function overriding and dynamic linkage/linking (virtual functions)\\n\\nTechnical Round #3\\n\\nGiven a 2d grid such that each row may have unequal number of columns\\n\\na, a1, a2 a3\\n\\nb, b1, b2\\n\\nc, c1, c2\\n\\nMySet = [] // set of all possible arrays {[a, b, c], [a, b, c1], [a, b, c2]}\\n\\nFind this set of all possible arrays formed.\\n\\nLengthy question - system design of a Cafeteria in college. Defining various components like Table, waiter, receptionist, kitchen, etc. Had to explain each link and how to efficiently make a system which would work well in high load scenarios - ex. break between classes in college, when everyone rushes to cafe.\\n\\nThe second system design question was more of a discussion and the entire time the interviewer was resolving queries and doubts. Like this question seems daunting but actually it isn’t. You just need to engage in conversation with interviewer and the solution will start building up.\\n\\nAlso in this round my entire CV was covered - each project was discussed, so make sure whatever you write - you know. \\n\\nTechnical Round #4\\n\\nThis puzzle : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/josephus-problem-set-1-a-on-solution/\\n\\n\\tCouldn’t give optimal solution but as it was my 4th interview, he didn’t mind.\\n\\nThis puzzle : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-16-100-doors/\\n\\nThis question : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/chocolate-distribution-problem-set-2/\\n\\n\\tBut instead of marks, there were only 5 grades A > B > C >  D > E\\n\\nCulture & Talent Round (C&T) aka HR\\n\\nTypical Questions:\\n\\nWhat do you know about Sprinklr and the work it does\\n\\nWhy Sprinklr\\n\\nTell me about one challenging time you faced\\n\\nTell me how teamwork helped you for eg in a project\\n\\nTell me something about you which is not in your CV\\n\\nTell me 2 areas where you feel you can improve\\n\\nTell me which core value of Sprinklr you identify with most\\n\\n\\tIf you don’t remember their values or stuff, like I did, directly say so.\\n\\nVineet:\\n\\n\\n\\nFirst round was CP based, second round was CV based (also probably the team you get in your internship) and third round was HR (formality), some people had 3 technical rounds.\\n\\nRound1: Interviewer was helpful and asked moderately difficult cp questions.\\n\\nGiven a binary tree, find the width of the tree, defined as the maximum number of nodes in any level with different x-coordinates. (assuming root 0, right move +1, left move -1).\\n\\nGiven an array, find the lexicographically smallest array possible by swapping adjacent elements with different parity. Gave an O(n2) solution but the interviewer helped a lot and finally got an O(n) solution.\\n\\nA common graph question based on dijkstra. (https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/useful-extra-edges/) same question but with undirected edges.\\n\\nRound2: First I got an interviewer from the product team but when I told I am interested in ML, an interviewer from ML team was arranged. Had some good discussion on my ML & DL based projects, so be prepared and truthful (really helps) of what you have done. And then some theoretical questions on CV and random forests (since they were part of my projects). One of my projects also involved NLP but because I mentioned that I haven’t studied NLP thoroughly he didn’t ask any questions from that.\\n\\nRound3(HR): Short interview, standard HR questions, was basically a formality.\\n\\nAditya Patidar - Sprinklr\\n\\n(2 Technical round + 1 HR round)\\n\\nTech round 1: I was asked to introduce myself. \\n\\nIt was followed by a short discussion on one of my project (OLX clone). How it is helpful and what all facilities does it provide to the users.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen i was asked whether i was familiar with linked list. It was followed by 2 questions on linked list.\\n\\nQ1: (Easy)To find whether 2  linked list intersect or not.\\n\\n\\u200b\\u200bhttps://www.interviewbit.com/problems/intersection-of-linked-lists/\\n\\nQ2: (Medium)To detect cycle in a linked list. If present find the node where the cycle begins.\\n\\nhttps://www.interviewbit.com/problems/list-cycle/\\n\\nBoth are standard linked list questions and are present  on InterviewBit.\\n\\nQ3: (medium) We have to find the duplicate number in an array of n+1 integers having integers from 1 to n in O(1) space and O(n) time complexity.\\n\\nhttps://www.interviewbit.com/problems/find-duplicate-in-array/\\n\\nQ4:(hard)Given an array of size n with all integers in range 0 to n-1. We have to rearrange the array so that Arr[i] becomes Arr[Arr[i]] with O(1) extra space.\\n\\nhttps://www.interviewbit.com/problems/rearrange-array/\\n\\nThere was 1 more question which i forgot :(\\n\\nTech round 2- \\n\\nQ1: It was an easy question to find the time complexity of a given code.\\n\\nQ2: To find the square root of a given positive integer.\\n\\nSol: Binary search. The interviewer just asked what all the code would include. Was not asked to code it.\\n\\nQ3: What is the difference between dfs and bfs. When to use dfs and when to use bfs.\\n\\nQ4: OOPS-> What is polymorphism.\\n\\nI told the definition and then told about 2 types of polymorphism run time and compile time polymorphism. He then asked about these in detail.  Had a bit long discussion about them.\\n\\nQ5:(Hard) I was asked to implement three stack operations (Inserting new element in stack, Popping out an element from stack, merging two stack-> \\n\\n\\n\\nmeans the new stack which has to be returned should contain the elements of the first stack followed by the elements of the second stack in their order). But all these operations were to be performed in O(1) time. \\n\\nI was asked to code it on google doc.\\n\\nSolution: Linked list was the perfect data structure to implement these as the inserting and popping could be done in some other data structure too but merging in O(1) time makes linked list a perfect choice here. You have to maintain the head and tail of the linked list(The elements of the linked list would represent our elements of the stack and in this way order too will be maintained). For merging 2 stacks in O(1) time the head of the second linked list should be added to the tail of the first linked list and then the new tail should be updated for the first linked list. The formed linked list represent our final stack.\\n\\nThe interviewer was very supporter .This question probably confirmed my selection. Had an almost 30min discussion on this question :)\\n\\nHR round: \\n\\nWas asked to introduce myself\\n\\nWas asked to tell about a incident in my life where i worked very hard to achieve my goal. The interviewer asked me to tell something other than my JEE journey :)\\n\\nWhat does sprinklr do. Do read about the company, what they do. Attend the PPT carefully.\\n\\nWas asked why sprinklr and not some other company. Also she asked me to tell my dream company other than sprinklr.\\n\\n\\n\\nPranjal Baranwal\\n\\nTechnical round 1\\n\\nIt started with the introduction and immediately he(the interviewer) started asking about my projects. He thoroughly discussed two of my projects like:\\n\\nHow are you making API calls? Show me through the networks tab.\\n\\nHow would you scale the project to serve more users?\\n\\nTell the database schema of the favourite button implemented\\n\\nWhy Django? and so on.\\n\\nThen he starts with a puzzle:\\n\\nSuppose in a country people have children till a boy is born. What is the expected no. of girls born before a boy is born?\\n\\nWhat is the probability of choosing two cards from a deck of 52 cards so that both are different suits and have different numbers? (Easy combinatorics)\\n\\nThe he asked me a coding question Merge two binary trees I explained the idea, and a dry run on a simple testcase, he seemed satisfied and asked me to code it on my preferred IDE and pass the same testcase and show the output using preorder traversal. I implemented it easily and he seemed satisfied.\\n\\nThen he said as we have some time left I have one more puzzle for you.\\n\\nYou and your friend are playing a game in which you have a heap of k stones. At one time you can remove 1, 2 or 3 stones. You and your friends play alternatively. What are the values of k for which you will always win if you and your friend play optimally.\\n\\nAns: {4n+1,4n+2,4n+3}\\n\\nOnce I told the answer he was convinced and asked me if you have any question for me. Make sure you have a good question ready before the round itself.\\n\\nTechnical round 2:\\n\\nThis interview had a bit off start for me but at the end I covered up.\\n\\nIt started with the introductions and the he asked me two puzzles:\\n\\nYou have 12 people in which 11 have same weight and the last one has a weight either less than or greater than the rest 11. You have a balance, now you have to find the odd guy and also tell whether his weight is more or less than others. You can use the balance at most 3 times. I was able to\\n\\n\\n\\npredict the starting moves but couldn’t solve it completely. Then he helped me to arrive at the answer.\\n\\nThere are 3 people who want to reach a destination which is 300 km far away. They can either ride on a bike ( 2 person at speed of 60km/hr) or walk individually ( @15km/hr). What is the time required to reach the destination.\\n\\nThough I was able to tell the idea of what would be the best case. I wasn’t able to arrive at the solution. \\n\\nThen he discussed all my projects in much depth( like first round) I was able to tell most of them convincingly. Then he scanned through my CV and found Formal languages as a subject in it. Then he asked what is context free grammar. (A bit of advice, don’t write the courses you are not confident in on your resume). Then he asked me two coding questions:\\n\\nImplement a stack with regular push and pop operation additionally implement find mid, delete mid and find mid where all operation are O(1). He also told me to create a google doc and share it with him. I discussed the approach and coded it successfully. Then he gave the next problem.\\n\\nReverse Alternate k nodes Though I was able to code it easily. To him it seemed that something was wrong and I had to explain the code 2-3 times then he understood.\\n\\nThen he asked if I had any question for him. Since I also wanted to know my evaluation as this round was a bit off. Firstly I asked about how is work culture of sprinklr. Then I also started with how much I was interested in joining the company. Then after this chat I was confident enough to ask my evaluation he said it was a bit off at the start and I could have done the initial puzzles easily with the approaches I started with and he said I would give you a good review. And after this a 1.5 hour long interview ended. And I knew that I had made it to the HR round.\\n\\nHR round:\\n\\nShe started with a her introduction and asked a few questions:\\n\\nTell me about yourself and about one of your achievements in life.\\n\\nWhy Sprinklr?\\n\\nWhat does Sprinklr do in brief?\\n\\nTell about a difficulty in life and how you overcame it. (Usually they look for leadership skills when asking such questions).\\n\\nCan’t remember but there were more\\n\\n\\n\\nFinally she gave my review and I got an email at the end from sprinklr I was very much relieved as this was my first interview and I was able to ace it.\\n\\n\\n\\nShivam Garg\\n\\nRound-1\\n\\nThe round started with interviewer asking me some web development question since I had a project regarding it in my CV. I told him that I am new to development and don’t know much about it. My profile was ML/AI based so I told him that I know ML and he can ask me regarding that. He wasn’t from ML domain and hence asked me 2 DSA questions instead. One of them was House Robber from Leetcode. Other question was the following: \\n\\nGiven an array ([0, n] index) containing  integers. We can do the following 3 operations:\\n\\nPick an index i and decrement by 1 all the numbers from [0, i] index.\\n\\nPick an index i and decrement by 1 all the numbers from [i, n] index.\\n\\nIncrement by 1 all the numbers from [0, n] index.\\n\\nWe want to make the complete array 0 i.e. all the numbers in the array must be 0. Determine the minimum number of operations to do this. \\n\\nRound went for about 45 min. I solved both the problems and coded them on google doc and hence was shortlisted for next round. \\n\\nRound-2\\n\\nThey called a person from ML domain to take my interview for this round. He first asked my about my ML/DL projects and asked all about the models I had used in them. He asked some basic questions regarding convolutions, precision, recall, accuracy, adam optimizer etc. \\n\\nHence this round was all about ML and he asked questions from very basic to advanced level. \\n\\nThis round went for about 1 hour. I wasn’t able to answer each and every question he asked but I think he didn’t even expected me to answer every question since they were asked from deep concepts.\\n\\nRound-3\\n\\nThis round was an HR round and went for about half hour. He asked me about my family and what they do. Then asked me to tell a incident where I had to think out of the box to solve the problem. \\n\\n\\n\\nThis round was more of a formality since everyone who reached this round got an offer from the company. \\n\\n\\n\\nNandini Sharma\\n\\nRound 1:\\n\\nA round purely based on dsa and your projects.\\n\\nHe asked me questions about the programming languages I know and my projects. He asked me questions on django, views etc.\\n\\nHe asked me how webrtc is different from sockets? \\n\\nHe asked me to implement a data structure with insertion, deep copy and print operation. Insert() and deepcopy() should be o(1) , print() o(n). \\n\\nHe asked me to implement json objects using classes. The class should include a function to update a json object when we pass another json object to this function.\\n\\nNo actual coding . You have to draw and explain your approach.\\n\\nRound 2:\\n\\nThe interviewer asked me to write actual code for these questions on any code editor. I got direct questions from interviewbit. \\n\\nFind the size of the largest square filled with 1s , given a binary matrix.\\n\\nGiven a binary matrix n×n with sorted rows. Find the row with max number of 1s in o(n).\\n\\nYou are given an array of integers. You cannot take consecutive elements. Find the maximum sum of the elements from this array.\\n\\nRound 3:\\n\\nThis was an HR round. She asked me how I handle pressure. What would I do if someone in my team is not working, your greatest learning from your worst day etc. They want you to show a positive attitude. At last I asked her about why she joined sprinklr, and what can I expect from the projects. I asked her if she wanted to suggest something to improve on.\\n\\n\\n\\nVikram Singla\\n\\nRound 1:\\n\\nIt was project based, and some basic CP questions were asked in this round.\\n\\nThe interviewer told me to explain my favorite project. Then he asked me about the implementation of some of its core features, and some improvements to the project, and how I would implement these improvements.\\n\\nNext he asked some CP problems.\\n\\nQuestion 1: Given a binary string of length n, is it possible to partition it into three substrings such that the value of the decimal numbers represented by the strings is equal? (For eg. 101001010101 can be partitioned into 101, 00101 and 0101, all of which have value equal to 101. ) (Very similar to this problem)\\n\\nQuestion 2: Given an array with every value repeating twice and a value once, find the value that appears only once (this problem). Then he further generalized and asked if all numbers appear m times, and a value appears n times (n<m), how will we find that number.\\n\\nI was asked to properly code the solutions to both the problems (on google docs) and dry run it on self made test cases.\\n\\nRound 2:\\n\\nThe interview was short and again CP based.\\n\\nMost of my interview was based on a single question.\\n\\nQuestion: Given is a list where each element is of the form (m,n) (m is the height of the person, n is the number of people in front of him having height greater than or equal to him). Restore the order in which people are standing. (this problem but the heights were not unique). \\n\\nI had not seen this problem before and thus it took me a considerable amount of time to come up with an O(n^2) solution. The interviewer was really helpful and after some hints from him, I was able to optimize the solution to O(nlogn) using segment trees.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe then told me to code the solution along with the segment tree data structure. Next he went through some theoretical questions related to segment trees (how they work, what is their time complexity, etc)\\n\\nSince only a small amount of time was left, he quickly asked some basic OOPS questions, and ended the interview.\\n\\nRound 3 (HR):\\n\\nIt was a short Interview with standard HR questions and was basically a formality. Just read about the company, what it does and some of its flagship products. Also, they emphasize a lot on sprinklr values, so make sure you know what they are and expect some questions based on them (like your favorite sprinklr values, etc).\\n\\nSparsh Mittal\\n\\n2 Technical interviews and 1 HR round\\n\\n1st Technical Interview: (around 30-40 mins)\\n\\nFirst, I was asked to introduce myself and talk about any one of my favourite projects.\\n\\nThen I was asked some basic questions on mongoDB, and the difference between SQL and MySQL.\\n\\nI was asked to solve a DSA question on binary trees, on any of my IDE. https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-of-splitted-binary-tree/\\n\\n2nd Technical Interview: (around 30 mins)\\n\\nFirst I was asked some basic questions on pointers, swapping them, etc.\\n\\nFollow up question was on the ways we can pass objects in a function as a parameter. Then, we had a discussion on lvalue and rvalue references.\\n\\nThen he asked about what happens when a function is called.\\n\\nLastly, a greedy question was asked from me.\\n\\no Suppose we are given a string of lowercase alphabets, we need to partition that string in such a way that the occurrence of any character occurs in the same partition.\\n\\no Eg. aabaacbgghgjk so we can partition it into aabaacb gghg j k,\\n\\nThen I asked him to whether find the maximum no. of partitions or any such partition, and he cleared that max no. of partitions was required. I suggested a greedy solution which he further asked me to prove which I did.\\n\\nHe also had a puzzle ready for me, which due to time constraints he was not able to ask. https://brainstellar.com/puzzles/probability/1\\n\\n\\n\\nHR Round: (30 mins)\\n\\nHR asked me the following questions:\\n\\no Why do you want to join sprinklr?\\n\\no Tell me a time in your life when everyone around you was pushing you down, still you recovered and how did you recover?\\n\\no Explain one of your projects s.t. Even a 10 year old is able to understand.\\n\\no 2 weakness and 2 strongpoints\\n\\no There were some more questions which I can’t recall.\\n\\nAdittya Gupta\\n\\nThe interview totally depends on your interviewer. If you are lucky then you could easily crack the interviews but in the worst case it can be a nightmare too. Mostly questions are from CP but you can expect pointers/OOPS/DBMS etc also so be prepared for that.\\n\\nRound 1\\n\\nThis round consisted of mainly CP questions. He asked me 3 questions. My interviewer didn’t know about C++ so he just asked me the logic and didn’t want the implementation from me. The first one was a greedy question which I don’t remember but I would say it was just a 1200-1300 CF rating question. The second was an implementation question which could be done very easily if you know basic data structures like map, set etc. The third was as follows :\\n\\nGiven an array of N integers find how many such triplets (i,j,k) exist such that A[i]<A[j]<A[k] and i<j<k\\n\\nI gave a solution using an ordered set and the interviewer was satisfied. This interview lasted for only 10-12 min but since the interviewer was satisfied with the answers he concluded the interview.\\n\\nRound 2\\n\\nThis round also had only CP questions. He asked me 2 questions.\\n\\nThe first was as follows:\\n\\nYou are given N integers from 1…..N. You have to order them so that there is exactly one local minima\\n\\nSoln:\\n\\nNotice that there always is a global minima at 1 so we want this global minima to be local minima also. So basically we want to have n-1 integers. We will choose k of them, order them in decreasing order on the left of 1 and take the n-1-k integers and order them in increasing order on the right of 1. So answer is basically\\n\\n\\n\\n∑(n-1)Ck from k = 0 to n-1\\n\\nThis is nothing but 2^(n-1) (Recall binomial theorem)\\n\\nAfter he was satisfied with the solution, he gave me the second question\\n\\nYou have an array of N atoms and a stack and at the ith turn you perform the following operation\\n\\nLet the value of ith atom be A_i\\n\\nIf stack is empty put the ith atom in the stack\\n\\nIf it is not compare the top most atom value\\n\\nIf they are equal fuse them to get the atom of value 2*A_i in your hand\\n\\nIf atom on top of stack is greater push the atom in your hand into the stack\\n\\nIf atom on top of stack is lesser than A_i then pop this atom and the current atom in your hand remains still in your hand\\n\\nRepeat this process until you have an atom in your hand\\n\\nYou have to tell the number of times each atom fused. For example if the array is 2 1 1\\n\\nThen in first op stack is 2\\n\\nIn second op stack is 2 1\\n\\nIn third op stack 2 1 1 -> 2 2 -> 4\\n\\nSo answer is 1 2 2 because atom of value 1 fused two times once with 1 and second time with 2\\n\\nI simulated the process and my algorithm ran in O((max time each atom can be fused)*N) complexity. I argued that max times each atom can be fused will be very low if we consider overflow because every time the value doubles so max time an atom can be fused is 64 if we consider long long integers in c++.\\n\\nHe was satisfied but in follow up he asked me what if we don’t consider overflow then my algorithm would run in O(N^2). After much thinking I figured out that I need to use\\n\\nDSU with some combinatorics or segment tree but since the time was already over he said that I was thinking in the right direction that a DSU + Segtree was required.\\n\\nHe didn’t pass me to the next stage. This interview lasted for about 60-70 min.\\n\\nSanjana Kolisetty\\n\\nRound 1 (Technical & Online)\\n\\n\\n\\nThe interviewer was young and just graduated from college. He was chill. He asked me to explain one of my projects with all the details. He asked me questions about the dataset used, pre-processing and how I trained the model and how long it took. He asked if I used GPU. After a long discussion, he said that even he did a similar project using the same dataset in college.\\n\\nIn that project, I used mapping to store features for every image. Then, he asked me the internal implementation of maps and unordered_maps in C++. I told him maps are binary search trees and unordered_maps are hash tables. So, he asked me to explain hashing. I told him whatever I know about hashing like collisions in hashing and different methods to resolve them.\\n\\nChaining –> He asked me worst case time complexity of it. In the worst-case scenario, all the values may be mapped to the same key, then, it’ll be O(n). I even told him about linear probing and modulo method.\\n\\nThen, he asked me the time complexity of maps -> O(logn) and unordered_maps -> O(1) is average case time complexity and O(n) is the worst case time complexity.\\n\\nHe asked me if I liked CP because I mentioned my CP achievements in my CV. I said yes and I was given two problems to solve.\\n\\nProblem 1:\\n\\nThere are people seated in an auditorium in the form of an m x n grid. Some people out of these are infected by a virus.\\n\\nEach cell in the grid is denoted by the following values:\\n\\n0 represents an empty seat where no one is seated.\\n\\n1 represents a seat occupied by a healthy person.\\n\\n2 represents a seat occupied by an infected person.\\n\\nEvery minute, each infected person spreads the virus to their 4-directionally adjacent people. Find how much time it will take for everyone in the auditorium to get infected.\\n\\nSolution: I told him it’s a classic multi source BFS problem and told him my approach. He sent me a Google Document and I implemented it. He asked me the time complexity of it.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\n\\nCheck if a given directed graph contains a black hole vertex. A black hole vertex is the one which points to no other vertex but all the other vertices point towards it.\\n\\nFor example, let’s say we have the following edges:\\n\\nV0 -> V1\\n\\n\\n\\nV2 -> V1\\n\\nV3 -> V1\\n\\nV4 -> V1\\n\\nV1 -> black hole vertex\\n\\nInput is adjacency matrix. https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/the-celebrity-problem/1\\n\\nSolution: I initially gave an O(n^2) approach using indegree and outdegree. The horizontal sum being outdegree and vertical sum being indegree. A black hole vertex’s outdegree is 0 and indegree is n-1. But he wanted O(n) approach. He gave me some hints and then I found an elimination method.\\n\\nAdjacency[i][j] = 0 => j can’t be a blackhole vertex\\n\\nAdjacency[i][j] = 1 => i can’t be a blackhole vertex\\n\\nI didn’t get to code it though.\\n\\nAfter this, he questioned me about OOPS.\\n\\n1. Explain any 3 OOPS concepts\\n\\n2. What is operator overloading?\\n\\n3. How is encapsulation achieved?\\n\\nThen, he questioned me on DBMS. They were basic questions.\\n\\n1. What is a database?\\n\\n2. What are relational databases?\\n\\n3. How do you find the relations between two databases?\\n\\n4. What is indexing used for?\\n\\n5. How does it optimize the performance?\\n\\nRound 2 (Technical & Online)\\n\\nThe interviewer started with problems directly.\\n\\nProblem 1: Given a set of n distinct integers, arrange them such that\\n\\na1 > a2 > a3 > a4 > ………... > ak < ak+1 < ak+2 < ak+3 < …………… < an, given ak can be the first as well as the last element.\\n\\nSolution: It is clear that ak is going to be the smallest integer from the set. All the other n-1 integers have two choices. They can either be on the left or on the right side of ak. The set of integers on the left and right have a fixed order. So, the final answer will be\\n\\n2*2*2*2*……. (n-1) times = 2(n-1)\\n\\nI was asked one more question which I don’t remember.\\n\\nAasneh Prasad\\n\\nInterview Round 1 (Technical & Online):\\n\\nWe directly jumped onto a Problem:\\n\\nQ) You are given a matrix of size NxM filled with 0s initially. You are given K operations of the such that in each operation you have to update a whole row or column with a particular value. Find the sum of all elements at the end of K operations.\\n\\nConstraints: 1<=N<=1e5, 1<=M<=1e5, 1<=N*M<=1e6, 0<=K<=1e5.\\n\\nApproach: I started off with the most obvious, naïve approach. The time complexity for that would be quadratic. I made a basic observation which helped me arrive at the solution:\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen I update a row, it will affect only the non-zero column values and only 1 instance of each if these values. Vice versa for column operations also. So just maintain a variable to keep sum of values of distinct rows/columns and when updating a row with value x we will add m*x to the answer but also subtract sum of non-zero values from the answer. This solution would work in O(K) and this was the desired time complexity. He asked me to code up the solution. As far as I remember this was the code:\\n\\nint Solution(int n, int m,vector<vector<int>>&query){\\n\\nint k=query.size();\\n\\nvector<int>vis_row(n,0);\\n\\nvector<int>vis_col(m,0);\\n\\nint ans=0;\\n\\nint sum_row=0;\\n\\nint sum_col=0;\\n\\nfor(int i=0;i<k;i++){\\n\\nint type=query[i][0];\\n\\nint j=query[i][1];\\n\\nint val=query[i][2];\\n\\nif(type==0){\\n\\nans+=m*val-sum_col;\\n\\nsum_row+=val-vis_row[j];\\n\\nvis_row[j]=val;\\n\\n}\\n\\nelse{\\n\\nans+=n*val-sum_row;\\n\\nsum_col+=val-vis_col[j];\\n\\nvis_col[j]=val;\\n\\n}\\n\\n}\\n\\nreturn ans;\\n\\n}\\n\\nHe went on to OOPs, asked about polymorphism, Compile time vs Runtime Polymorphism,\\n\\nBasic details about them. He then went onto DBMS, I don’t remember what exactly he asked but it was some basic stuff only related to normalization and types of keys etc. doable questions. The interview ended with me asking some basic questions about Sprinklr and the role to be offered.\\n\\n\\n\\nInterview Round 2 (Technical & Online):\\n\\nThis was by far the worst interview experiences I have ever had. I found the interviewer to be very rude and uninterested in the interview, I don’t know why. He even switched off his camera within 5 minutes of start of the interview. Be prepared for such experiences also. Anyway he started off with some questions:\\n\\nQ) Implement a vector class.\\n\\nApproach: I used dynamic memory allocation for this. Keep 3 pointers\\n\\n1) Points to the first element (v.begin())\\n\\n2) Points to last element (--v.end())\\n\\n3) Points to the end of the memory area allocated\\n\\nI explained to him if my declared memory allocated is of size N and while inserting the elements if they become more than N then I double my memory allocation to size 2*N and continue my insertion. If I am deleting my elements from memory allocated size N and the number of elements become <=N/2 I decrease my memory allocated size to N/2.\\n\\nFollow Up: He then asked me create a function that returns a Deep Copy of the vector whenever it’s called in O(1).\\n\\nI was clueless for this part. I could think of nothing but maintaining several copies of the vector and sending one of those whenever the function is called but that would obviously restrict the number of calls of the function that can be made. I voiced out this approach but it was in vain ☹. I could not think of anything else nor did the interviewer seem to give any hint ☹. He moved on to another question.\\n\\nQ) Implement a Map class with functions:\\n\\n1. Set(x,y) à H[x]=y.\\n\\n2. Get(x) àreturns H[x].\\n\\n3. Put(x) à Sets value of all keys to x.\\n\\nImplement all these functions in O(1). He told me I could use the map function in C++.\\n\\nHe asked me to just code up the solution without explaining him so I did that.\\n\\nApproach: maintain two unordered maps.\\n\\nValue[x]à denotes the value at key x.\\n\\nTime[x] à denotes the latest time at which the key x was updated.\\n\\nMaintain a variable T (initialised with 0). Increment T every time Set or Put function is called. Maintain a variable T’ which denotes the latest time at which Put(x) function was called. Maintain a variable Latest_value which denotes the latest value with which Put(x) was called.\\n\\n\\n\\nSet(x,y):\\n\\nT++;\\n\\nValue[x]=y;\\n\\nTime[x]=T;\\n\\nGet(x):\\n\\nIf(T’>Time[x]): Return Latest_value;\\n\\nReturn Value[x];\\n\\nPut(x):\\n\\nT++;\\n\\nT’=T;\\n\\nLatest_value=x;\\n\\nAfter coding up the solution he said he didn’t understand the solution. I tried explaining and convincing him a lot, he still didn’t agree if this solution would work, I don’t know why ☹.\\n\\nWe then went onto certain parts of my projects he told me to give an overview of them, what I could improve in them etc. Then he asked me questions on OOPs related to Inheritance, Polymorphism… basic questions. He then went to DBMS, asked about Normalization, their forms and some other basic stuff. He then put up a another problem. I don’t remember it but within 2 minutes of proposing the question he said the time ended and he just left the meet didn’t even say bye :☹.\\n\\nSprinklr\\n\\nSneh Dadhania - Intern offered\\n\\nNeither OOPs nor DBMS was asked to me.\\n\\nSprinklr is notorious for grilling you on Projects but I was lucky in this case.\\n\\nSome questions of CP/DSA asked were not standard.\\n\\n1st Round:\\n\\nShort intro(nothing on projects) \\n\\n\\n\\n + 2 DSA/CP Questions\\n\\nI was asked to provide the pseudocode for both of them on Google docs.\\n\\n1st question(took 35 mins approx)\\n\\nN cities are there and an adjacency matrix is given.\\n\\nCheck if a city exists which has no outgoing edge and has an incoming edge from every other city.\\n\\nO(N^2) is pretty straightforward, he wanted me to optimize it.\\n\\nI thought a bit and then told him a 2 pointer based approach, solving in O(n).\\n\\nThe interviewer was kind enough to correct me whenever I said something wrong.\\n\\n2nd question(10mins)\\n\\nYou are given a binary tree with n nodes and each node has a value associated with it. If you don't choose a node you can't choose any of its descendants, if you choose a node you can choose its descendants. Tell the maximum value you can obtain from the tree.\\n\\n2nd Round:\\n\\nDiscussion on projects 1 of my choice and 1 of his choice (15mins)+ 1CP question(40mins)\\n\\n(He had his own way to ensure that the CV belonged to me)\\n\\nHe played a fill in the blanks game with my CV. Like where did you store vectorised chunks _____. Model used for generating embeddings is ______.\\n\\nHe was interested in my first project and wanted to know the difference between RAG and LLMs.k\\n\\nQuestion 1:\\n\\nGiven an array of size n\\n\\n\\n\\nMake a new array from the given array such that at each index of the new array store the maximum value among the duplicates that have occurred till that index in the previous array.\\n\\nIf no duplicates are found till that index, store a zero.\\n\\nKeep forming new arrays till you get an array with all indexes having only zeroes.\\n\\nFind the sum of all elements of all the arrays that were formed including the starting array.\\n\\nIt took me some time to reach the solution because there are quite many edge cases.\\n\\nI told him O(n^2) approach using map and thought that should be it but he wanted me\\n\\nto optimize it.\\n\\nI had to observe that elements started shifting to right after 1-2 iterations using Maps and I didn't have to form all intermediate arrays.\\n\\nHe didn't even ask me to write the pseudocode, that made me think he got frustrated as I took a lot of time but I was immediately called for the HR Round.\\n\\nHR Round:\\n\\nPlease for God's sake read what the company does, don't go unprepared like me.\\n\\nTips:\\n\\n Keep saying whatever comes to your mind, like when told to optimize O(n^2), speak of possibilities like 2 pointers, binary search and he might nudge you in the correct direction.\\n\\nDon't think quietly. Give mock interviews so you are well prepared and grab the opportunity you get.(OA’s are hard to clear for slot 1 especially if you aren't a pro at cp/dsa)\\n\\nMake sure to bruteforce and hardcode that helped me get shortlisted for Sprinklr :).\"),\n",

There is a HR round as\\n\\nwell but it is not a deciding round.\\n\\nInterview 1:\\n\\nOnly one person interviewed me. First asked me to introduce myself. After that he\\n\\nasked me about some of my projects. After he started asking questions on digital electronics\\n\\nQ : What negative setup time means.\\n\\nA : It occurs due to skew between clocks.\\n\\nQ : How k-map solves minterms to get gate level minimization.\\n\\nQ : Circuit is given and asked what is the maximum frequency at which it operates (STA ).\\n\\nQ : Asked to design a circuit which gives 1 when sequence (01-5times) is detected and 0 when\\n\\nsequence (10-5times) is detected.\\n\\nLater I received a call to finalize my order (digital / analog) and asked some questions like\\n\\nwhat I know about TI, How is interview etc…\\n\\n\\n\\nTexas Instruments Digital Design intern\\n\\nTanmay Deshmukh\\n\\nThere were three rounds\\n\\n1) Written test\\n\\n2) Technical interview\\n\\n3) HR round\\n\\n1) Written test :- For Hardware profile the test consist of 3 sections (analog, digital and aptitude) consisting of 20 questions each.  The analog section consists of questions on rc circuits, opamps, frequency response, BJT and MOSFET curcuits. Questions in digital were from registers and counters, static timing analysis, finite state machines, and verilog. The aptitude section simply had some logical questions which were very easy to solve. The time for digital and analog section was 45 mins each and for the aptitude section it was 30 mins.\\n\\n2) Technical interview :- \\n\\na) First of all the interviewer asked me to explain my projects. Then he started asking me questions on my projects like how did you implement all that stuff, what circuits you used etc. For verilog projects he asked me about different modules in the code. How many FSMs were there, how many states each FSM had, then he asked me to write the codes for some modules and then he told me to do some changes in the code and asked me about the behaviour of the code. \\n\\nb) Then he asked me to design a circuit which would cut the clock signal when an enable signal is on otherwise the output will be same as the clock. Here the constrain was that even if the enable signal is on it should cut the clock only after the falling edge of the clock. \\n\\nc) He also asked me to design a nor gate using only 2:1 mux. Here I was not allowed to use any gates. So I have only A and B as inputs. I could not use even A' or  B' as inputs. He also asked me that if this circuit is not possible to design then prove that it is not possible to design.\\n\\nd) Lastly he asked me some questions on static timing analysis like given a sequential circuit find the maximum frequency of the clock, check hold and setup time violations.\\n\\n3) HR Round :- This round was just a talk with the HR. She just asked me about how was the interview, what questions were asked during the interview and  about the pre placement talk. Then she asked me my feedback for the pre placement talk.\\n\\nDigital design intern\\n\\nShyam Amipara\\n\\nThere were two rounds:\\n\\n1) online test\\n\\n2) interview\\n\\n1) The online test was more flexible than other companies. I registered for Hardware (Analog+Digital) profile and Software profile. So, I had to take Analog, Digital, Software and Aptitude Assessments. The online test was highly proctored. After the online test, I was shortlisted for Digital Design interview.\\n\\n2) There were four interviewers in my panel. The interview started with normal greetings. Since it was raining that day, my internet connection was poor, but the interviewers were very cooperative about it and made me feel comfortable. \\n\\nThe first question was about deriving a function from given minterms, which was pretty basic. I drew a K-map and got the answer. I was asked about why we use gray code in K-map than simple binary. \\n\\nThe second question was about designing 3-input Nand gate from 2-input Nand Gates. They then generalized this question and asked about designing n-input Nand gate from 2-input Nand gates. The questions also revolved around how how time delay, and no. of gates will grow with n.\\n\\nThe third questions was on flip-flop. I was given a input signal, clock and output signal and i was asked to design a circuit which will satisfy the input output relation. I started with a D flipflop and faced some issues in between which were cleared by one of the interviewer. I was not confident about this topic but the key is to think loudly and actively talk with the interviewers.\\n\\nLastly, i was asked how many unique Boolean functions are possible with n variables and i was also asked to derive the formula for the same.\\n\\nThat concluded the technical interview.\\n\\nAfter 5-6 hours of the above interview, i received a phone call from the HR, asking about hiw was the overall interview experience. We chatted a bit about 'general' things and that was it. The HR call hardly lasted 10 mins.\"),\n",

I had built a note-taking app (similar to Google Docs or Notion) and was most confident in that. He probably didn’t look at the projects before the interview. He went on to ask about every single detail of this project. Some specific qs he asked that I remember-\\n\\nWalk me through all the features of your app, starting from login.\\n\\nWhat difficulties did you face working on this project?\\n\\nTold him that this was a learning project and I had to learn so many different things, that was a big challenge. Then moved to describe the specific problem of implementing WYSIWYG editors. He then asked me how did I solve that, and that was basically\\n\\nWhich databases did you use? Why was this the best way to store data for this app?\\n\\nTold me to write down the entire schema\\n\\nTo justify the use of SQL I had to write some sample queries in SQL and MongoDB\\n\\nIf let's say you have to add a new feature and add permission for users like in Google Docs, how will you modify your schema for that?\\n\\nHow did you manage concurrency with multiple users working on your app simultaneously?\\n\\nTold him about the libraries I used to support this, slate.js and socket.io\\n\\nI described their inner working to explain how concurrency is handled in my app, then had to write some React code to explain what I had to do.\\n\\nHow scalable is your app?\\n\\nTold him that I need to implement a Redis cache and improve the way I save documents to make it more scalable\\n\\nWhat are your future plans with this project? What features would you like to add?\\n\\nWere you able to achieve what you intended with this project?\\n\\nMy aim was just to learn, so told him about all the various cool stuff I learned. And one thing I learned was GraphQL, then he asked me the final q-\\n\\nWhy did you use GraphQL? What are its benefits over REST and what are its limitations?\\n\\n\\n\\nFor the limitations, I mentioned that GraphQL had to implement its own caching mechanism, but forgot to mention the n+1 problem. If you used GraphQL in your project do look up this.\\n\\nRound 1\\n\\n( Coding Round, about 1 hr):\\n\\nFirst, the interviewer asked me about my projects. We had a short project discussion, involving typical questions like what was your idea for the project and so on. \\n\\nHe then asked, “which one did you like more, cp or projects?”\\n\\nI answered they both are related and required to get better at coding. Cp is solving problems short term while developing problem-solving abilities, which working projects would be long term, taking weeks or months, where we’re trying to apply would problem-solving abilities to solve real-world problems in a meaningful way.\\n\\nThen he moved on to asking DSA. He started with “how good are you in DSA?” then he gave me this q- Given an n-ary rooted tree, a signal is given to the root at time t=0. Every second, all nodes having the signal pass it on to one of their children (while also retaining it themselves). How much time will it take for all nodes of the tree to get the signal?\\n\\nIt took a lot of time to arrive at the answer, although it is actually simple. One thing I learned from this is that it's better to try out a few test cases to get a better feel of the question and it will also clarify the question. The solution involves running a dfs over the tree and for each node we calculate time it’ll take for the subtree rooted at this node. He also asked me to code it on a google doc, which I did easily.\\n\\nHe then asked me about string matching (KMP algorithm), and told me to explain the algorithm.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\DELL\\\\OneDrive\\\\Desktop\\\\genai1\\\\data\\\\Internship Interview Experiences\\\\Uber.docx'}, page_content=\"Uber company interveiw questions and experiences 2021\\n\\nCoding Round (1 hour)\\n\\nConvert a number from Base 2 to Base 6. The number was given as a vector containing 100 binary digits, and we had to return an output vector. (Since the number is too large to fit in long long in c++, the question is simple if you use python). Most people could only solve this partially.\\n\\nYou have n positions and you can fill each position with a number from l to r. How many arrangements can you have such that the sum of numbers is a multiple of 3? (n was 10^5 and l, r were between 1 and 10^9)\\n\\nFind the number of ways to construct a building with n floors of three types, Official, residential and cafeteria. Subject to conditions:\\n\\nThere can be at most one cafeteria.\\n\\nThere cannot be three or more consecutive official floors.\\n\\nPeople who solved Q2&Q3 completely + Q1 at least partially, were shortlisted for the interviews.\\n\\nStats:\\n\\nRound 1: 16 shortlisted\\n\\nRound 2: 8 shortlisted\\n\\nHR Round: 6 shortlisted\\n\\nFinal Selection List: 2 people (does not include people who got companies higher on their preference list)\\n\\nPranav Vinchurkar\\n\\n1st round (45 mins)\\n\\nI have N machines which have to function in a particular order. I also have M conditions, each of form (A, B): Machine A will have to function before Machine B. \\n\\nQuestion: How will you check if there is a possible ordering of machines, such that all of them function. (Solution: Consider each machine as a node of a graph. If A has to function before B, make a directed edge from node A to node B. There is a valid ordering, if the graph has no directed cycles. Do that by running a simple DFS (Each node has 3 states: Unprocessed, \\n\\n\\n\\nprocessing, processed. When you enter a node, mark it as processing, and when you exit it, mark it as processed. If you try to enter a node which is already under processing, you have found a directed cycle)\\n\\nThen she asked me to code it (Print yes/no), and run my code on a few test cases.\\n\\nThen I was asked to print any valid ordering (topological sort)\\n\\nThen I was asked about the time complexity of my code, and justify it.\\n\\nSince time was left, the interviewer started speaking about life at Uber and told me that she trains/mentors interns as well.\\n\\n2nd round (45 mins)\\n\\nMy interviewer was a IITM CSE graduate\\n\\nThis round was simple, it was about being able to implement classes.\\n\\nI have a restaurant menu. The menu can contain several dishes and each dish has several ingredients. Dishes have properties like price, name, etc.\\n\\nI want to be able to support the following operations: (initially just a few basic operations)\\n\\n1 ) Insert a dish in the menu\\n\\n2 ) Display all dishes of the menu\\n\\n3 ) Count the number of dishes in the manu with a particular ingredient.\\n\\nI created a class called Dish. It stored a vector of ingredients.\\n\\nAnd I also created a class Menu, which has a vector containing objects of class Dish. \\n\\nAdded supporting functions in classes as needed. Simple brute force.\\n\\nThen he asked me to modify the classes to I can support more operations:\\n\\n1 ) Return all pairs of dishes with total price <=X. (just did quadratic brute force)\\n\\n2 ) Return Dishes which have a particular ingredient and don’t have a particular ingredient.\\n\\n3 ) Combination of 1) and 2), did not have to code this one, just was asked how would I make sure the code for this doesn’t get messy.\\n\\n3rd round (HR round) (30 mins)\\n\\nThen I was asked to choose any project I had done and explain every single detail/technologies used. The interviewer enthusiastically listened to whatever I described, and asked a lot of follow up questions. \\n\\nHe then asked me what challenges I faced while making it, why I decided to make the project, what improvements can be made, etc. \\n\\nThen I was asked how I would design an Airport Management System and what data structures I would use, what factors I would consider to decide which plane to land on a runway, taking care of departure, parking of planes, etc. (No coding required). I came up with a combination of a priority queue (with priority decided by a combination of factors like fuel left, waiting time, etc), a balanced BST (set) and a vector of queues.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen he asked me to describe a time I had experienced a failure in my life \\n\\nHe asked me if I had any questions. I asked him what was expected from interns at Uber. He then spoke for 3-4 mins, about the kind of projects done by interns, the work done by his team, etc.\\n\\nIn all the Uber interviews, they never check anyone’s resume.\\n\\nAhaan Sameer Malhotra\\n\\nRound 1 (OOPS Round)-\\n\\nIf I remember correctly, I had to introduce myself to start. Then, I had to implement an Uber employee management system, with functions :\\n\\nAdd an employee with a given managerId.\\n\\nReturn the immediate juniors of an employee.\\n\\nRemove an Employee. His direct juniors become direct juniors of the removed guy’s boss.\\n\\nChange the Boss of An Employee- a.) His juniors do as in his removal, b.) His juniors go with him to the other dept.\\n\\nSo, I made two classes, one for the employee storing their direct juniors and manager; the other for the organization as a whole, storing a vector of employees and having the reqd 4 functions. The interviewer created the 2 subparts for 4, only when I asked him.\\n\\nRound 2 (Coding Round)-\\n\\nUnlike my first day of interviews, I had to introduce myself in most interviews the next day. So, I can’t distinctly remember how this one started.\\n\\nAnyways, I was asked one CP question. When you try searching for a place on the Uber app, you are shown suggestions of places that have the search string as a prefix. So, given a search string and an array of strings that are basically names of places in that city, I need to find all those places that could be used as suggestions for the given search. I suggested an algorithm where I simply search each array string whether the first len(search) characters match or not. He asked me its complexity, O(len(search) * size(places)).\\n\\nThen, I had to improve my runtime, in case of multiple queries. I used a trie. While searching, I reached the last prefix node and then just did a dfs to return all strings. Had to code it. My code was run against some simple tests prepared then and there. I got a seg. fault twice due to minor errors, but it ran perfectly on correcting them.\\n\\nRound 3(HR Round)-\\n\\n\\n\\nUnlike the Sprinklr HR, this guy had technical knowledge. He first asked me about one of my projects (I think I had to choose one). I explained what I did, the database I used – simple things you’ll know if you’ve done it yourself.\\n\\n Then, he gave me a situation where I need to allocate courses to students, given some eligibility constraints (branch, etc). I wasn’t very sure whether I had to do something like JOSSA, or make sure everyone gets a course or what. He did seem to agree when I asked, if it's to be done based on CPI, but then the next line he seemed to say something contradictory (: .So, I just said that I'll go from high C.P.I to low CPI, then from most preferred to least, and allocate each student one course. When asked about its drawbacks, I did explain that everyone may not get a course while there may exist some distribution that does so.\\n\\nThen he asked some boring HR Questions (4 of them maybe) – some incident where you had a disagreement with your help in some decision, and how did you resolve it, etc etc etc.. There were one or two where I wasn’t able to think of anything, and just frankly told him that instead of making up a story\\n\\nHardik Suhag \\n\\nRound 1:\\n\\nI was asked a system design question in my first technical round. “Write a neat c++ code for a restaurant model (they explained the model)“. \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\n\\nNeat of course meant I had to use OOPs etc. I was expected to use classes for menus, dishes, ingredients etc. and write methods such as get_all_dishes_having(indeg.), get_all_dishes_cheaper_than(price) efficiently. Most of the methods could be handled efficiently by standard sets and maps in c++. \\n\\nTry to keep talking to the interviewer while writing the code. He asked some questions regarding the time complexity of my methods and some c++ syntax I used.\\n\\nRound 2:\\n\\nMy second technical round was entirely cp.\\n\\nQ1: Print out all possible permutations of a string. He was expecting a recursive function (I think it’s on interviewbit as well). For argument’s sake, I told him there’s a c++ next_perm() function. He asked me to code it. He executed and checked for corner cases and duplicated cases etc. and then seemed satisfied. He asked me the complexity as well (which is Θ(n.n!) since you have to print all permutations anyway). \\n\\nQ2: You are given a parking lot with slots numbered from 1-n, represented by a binary array. Initially all slots are empty (a[i] = 0; for all i). As cars come and go, each car needs to be parked in such a manner that its distance from the nearest car is maximised.\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\n\\n\\nThis can be done by maintaining two sets of empty intervals, one ordered by the size of intervals (s1) and the other ordered by position of intervals (s2). To remove a car, fetch the corresponding interval from s2 and then remove it from s1 as well and then add the combined interval in both sets again. To insert a car, fetch the largest interval from s1 and remove it from s2 as well, place the car in the center and break it into two intervals. (Needless to say, the interval is a pair <i,j>). Complexity - O(log(n)) per operation.\\n\\nQ3: Following the previous question he asked how c++ sets work. I told him self balancing BSTs like AVL, or RB trees. I proceeded to explain how AVL trees worked in detail after that. He was satisfied.\\n\\nRound 3(HR Round):\\n\\nProject Discussion\\n\\nVarenyam Bakshi\\n\\nRound 1 (Problem Solving):\\n\\nStarted with a quick introduction from both sides. Then she asked me a dp question. You are given a car with initial fuel and you have to reach the “target” distance. It travels 1 km in 1 litre. There are N gas stations in between with the fuels in them. Your aim is to reach the target distance with a minimum number of refuelings. \\n\\nCame up with an N^2 dp solution. I had to code it and she ran some sample test cases as well. Although my code failed on some test cases, she didn’t eliminate me as my logic was correct and she said the code would work after some minor changes.\\n\\nRound 2 ( OOPS / Design ):\\n\\nI had to implement a restaurant menu system. I was given explanations of the functions which need to be implemented. The interviewer didn’t provide all the functions at once. You have to implement the class in such a way that reduces code redundancy. \\n\\nTry to use meaningful names for variables and functions. The functions to be implemented are provided in such an order which requires calling previously implemented functions. Was able to implement all the functions in the given time.\\n\\nRound 3 ( Tech / HR) : \\n\\nAgain started with a quick introduction from both sides. My interviewer had 10+ years of experience. He asked me to choose my favorite project and explain it. \\n\\n\\n\\nI explained one of my ML projects for the next half an hour. Actually he didn’t have any knowledge of ML and so couldn’t ask any counter-question and it was just me explaining everything. \\n\\nShubham Shankar\\n\\nRound 1: Design some kind of ticket system, the problem description was long but it was easy only.\\n\\nRound 2: Second was given a list of input strings and a target string to find all input strings which contain the target string as prefix . I think they wanted a trie based approach.\\n\\nHR Round:\\n\\nExplain a project on your resume . What were the challenges faced in the project? \\n\\nDesign an attendance management system . Here basically supposed you are a prof taking many courses you want to keep track of for each of your courses , which student has attended how many classes . \\n\\nThe attendance management system was open ended like you could take the discussion whichever way you wanted. I didn't go for a database approach because I was not very comfortable with it.\\n\\nUsing database concepts was not necessary.\\n\\nThen he asked me why I wanted to work at Uber.\\n\\nUber company interveiw questions and experiences 2023\\n\\nAasneh Prasad\\n\\nCoding Round:\\n\\n3 questions - 1 hour time limit:\\n\\nQ1) You are given an array of N integers. You can replace two adjacent numbers (x,y) in the array by their lcm if gcd(x,y)>1. Find the array left after applying this operation to the array such that you can no longer apply it anymore.\\n\\nConstraints: N<=1e3, ai<=1e9.\\n\\nApproach: Basic idea is if you are able to compress the array from indices iàj then you have to check if you can compress further more by going back from indices i-1 à 1. This approach takes O(N2).\\n\\n\\n\\nQ2) You are given a N sized Array of integers and an integer K . Ai denotes the tickets required by the ith person. Each Second you can provide 1 ticket to the person at start of array and send him to the end of array. If a person acquires the required number of tickets, he is removed from the array. Find the minimum time to fulfil the kth person’s demand.\\n\\nConstraints: N<=1e5, 1<=K<=N.\\n\\nApproach: Let Ans=0;\\n\\nFor all indices 1àk:\\n\\nAns+=min(Ai,Ak)\\n\\nFor all indices k+1àN:\\n\\nAns+=min(Ai,Ak-1).\\n\\nAs far as I remember I think this was the approach.\\n\\nQ3) You are given a Binary string S consisting of 0s and 1s. You can create a bouquet of rose with 3 consecutive 0s and earn p coins or u can create a bouquet of rose and lilly with 1 and 0 but these must be consecutive and earn q coins. Find maximum coins you can earn.\\n\\nConstraints: N<=1e5.\\n\\nApproach: This is a DP problem. Let DPi denote the maximum coins you can earn using the string upto ith Position.\\n\\nTransitions:\\n\\n1) Dpi=max(Dpi,Dpi-1)\\n\\n2) If(Si = Si-1 = Si-2 = 0):\\n\\nDpi=max(Dpi,Dpi-3 + p)\\n\\n3) If(Si != Si-1):\\n\\nDpi=max(Dpi,Dpi-2 + q)\\n\\nOutput DpN.\\n\\nUber company interveiw questions and experiences 2024\\n\\nAAGAM BHAVESH MEHTA\\n\\nIntern Offered\\n\\nOffline Interviews\\n\\nSDE Role\\n\\nOA : \\n\\nOnline\\n\\nIt consisted of 3 dsa questions and we were given a time of 90mins.\\n\\nQuestions were mostly in the medium to hard difficulty range around div2 C/D.\\n\\nThey were doable if you had good practice of CP.\\n\\nOne was a simple one which involved mainly sorting and some greedy approach.\\n\\nThe Other two had good use of DP and were mostly non-standard dp type questions.\\n\\nYou had to do all the three questions to be able to get shortlisted.\\n\\n\\n\\nRound 1 : \\n\\n( Technical Round )\\n\\nThis was majorly the DSA / CP round.\\n\\nI was nervous before the interview lakin after meeting the interviewer it was all good. We exchanged our intros and then we started off with the interview.\\n\\nI was asked two questions during the interview.\\n\\nAs I had a good grasp on CP by the time of interview, the questions asked seemed simple to me.\\n\\nThe questions that were asked are :  \\n\\nWe were given two integers as the input N and a threshold.\\n\\nThere are N numbers from 1…N and if any common divisor between two numbers is greater than the threshold then there exists an edge between those two numbers.\\nThen we were given Q queries each having two integers and we had to return whether there exists a path between those two numbers.\\nIt was a standard DSU question and building the graph could be easily done using sieve type algo in o(nlogn) time and then for each queries it could be answered in O(1) time.\\n\\nI told him the approach using some examples and drawing a graph using pen and paper and he was satisfied with my approach.\\n\\nThen I was asked to implement the entire code along with the DSU.\\n\\nThen he made me run some test cases for testing the code.\\n\\nI asked him what the constraints for N could be to which he replied INT_MAX and it was obvious that he was not much aware that we can not make vector of such great size so there are chances that the interviewer might himself not know some stuff so if you are not able to get to the exact solution then just go along with the solution that comes to your head with full confidence.\\n\\tThe exact same question on leetcode : \\n\\nhttps://leetcode.com/problems/graph-connectivity-with-threshold/description/\\n\\nWe are given N nodes and a list of edges which represent a bidirectional edge between them.\\n\\nWe had to calculate the inconvenience caused when we start deleting the edges in the order in which they are given.\\n\\nInconvenience caused = (a,b) such that a<b and node b is not reachable from node a.\\n\\nIt was also a DSU question but that catch here was to just start calculating answers from inserting edges in the reverse order to which they were given.\\n\\nI explained my approach to him and he was satisfied with my approach.\\n\\nI asked him if I should implement but he said he was satisfied without implementing and the interview ended.\\n\\nTIP : \\n\\nPractice Graphs and DP to a good level and be confident and always keep trying different approaches if you are not able to come to the solution directly.\\n\\n\\n\\nRound 2 : \\n\\n(Technical interview mainly system design)\\n\\nSame like the first interview, we exchanged our intros and then directly jumped to the coding part. I had to code on the ‘codesignal’ platform.\\n\\nThe question was that I was given a Meeting Management System.\\n\\nIt consists of rooms and users and the users can schedule a meeting in a particular room if possible or in any other room if possible.\\n\\nThis interview was kaafi jyada hectic like he gave me a description of 6 functions which he wanted me to code within 40 mins and that too with the best of system design principles that were possible.\\n\\nHere also the interviewer was very good and helped me whenever I was stuck and discussed all the problems in my implementation.\\n\\nI was able to implement only 5 functions and he asked me to write a pseudocode for the 6th one. He looked satisfied with my way of implementing using oops.\\n\\nThere were also follow up questions during the time when I was implementing and also asked me to implement some more functionalities.\\n\\nTIPS : \\n\\nThoroughly get yourself well versed with the system design concepts mainly the low level system design as you will be asked to implement in the interview and the entire interview moves around system design.\\n\\nDo not make the same mistake as mine of studying system design for 2hrs only.\\n\\nIf you know that there are chances of you getting shortlisted then just start preparing for system design as it will be surely asked.    \\n\\nRound 3 : \\n\\n(Technical interview with hr questions and system design)\\n\\nSame like the first interview, we exchanged our intros.\\n\\nHe then told me to explain any project from my cv and then there were typical hr questions regarding how to work as a team, what difficulties we faced and how did we resolve them as a team, what was my contribution to the project, why did we choose a particular tech stack over some other tech stack and similar questions.\\n\\nThen since I had websocket written in my cv, he told me to design a whatsapp kind of an app where there will be multiple groups and multiple users and also asked me to implement all the functionalities required for a group chat on paper.\\n\\nHe asked me to write codes for all the classes that will be needed.\\n\\nHe then went on to ask some questions regarding conflicts that would arise during multiple users sending messages at the same time and asked how I would try to resolve these conflicts.\\n\\nThen there were some more hr type questions and he looked fairly satisfied with the way I had approached all the questions.\\n\\nTIPS :\\n\\n\\n\\nPrepare well for CP / DSA kyuki it will be very helpful during the interviews as well as OAs.\\n\\nPractice for system design type questions and also try implementing the functions by yourself.\\n\\nTry to have at least one group project in your cv as it looks good to the hr that you are good at working as a team.\\n\\nBe true about what you say in the hr round, they value honesty.\\n\\nAgar websockets hai cv me toh fir surely they are going to ask about it and agar nahi hai fir bhi read some basics about it as there are chances that they'll ask about it. \"),\n",

We had to write the code and also run the test cases. I’d suggest going through this link and standard questions on Interviewbit before the interview. The interviewers were very friendly. \\n\\nOnly two students gave the third round (HR round) in which the interviewer asked about all the projects on my resume and the motive behind them. He also asked why I chose those specific technologies over others for doing the project. Apart from this it was just a discussion on my hobbies and things I like to do in my free time.\\n\\nRound 1: \\n\\nQ1. Given nested lists in the input, we had to find the sum of the depth of the list multiplied by the elements in the list. \\n\\nThe question was a little vague as it was not clear as to how we had to take the input. So I discussed this with the interviewer and he said it was okay to take a vector of vectors even though that method would only work for inputs where the max depth was 2. It worked for the first input so the interviewer seemed satisfied.\\n\\nQ2. Link\\n\\nRound 2:\\n\\nQ1. Link\\n\\nQ2.

Then I solved it by recursion.\\n\\nAfter solving these two questions there was around 5-10 min time left so he asked me to do the second question by using iterative method and while I was solving by using a queue, time ran out and we ended the session.\\n\\n2nd Round (PROBLEM SOLVING ROUND) :\\n\\nAt the beginning, interviewer asked how the previous round went and then we started solving coding questions.\\n\\nFirst question is based on trees and the second is based on dfs and backtracking.\\n\\nAfter coding both of them roughly 10-15 minutes left so he asked questions related to graphs . Asked some basic dfs,bfs questions and Dijkstra’s algorithm.  \\n\\n3rd Round (HR ROUND):\\n\\nSpent quite a time on CV. Was asked to explain about  the projects mentioned in CV and\\n\\nexplain everything . Spent around 15 mins to explain the algorithm used, how it worked , etc.\\n\\nFollowed up with questions like 'Why did you choose to do this ? What was the motivation? What difficulties did you face while making it? \\n\\nLater he asked to explain a coding question which you find challenging recently.\\n\\nAt the end I asked my doubts related to uipath and the interviewer answered and the session ended.\\n\\nTips for the UIPATH Interviews\\n\\n     Competitive programming is  most important.Both rounds are based on completely coding\\n\\n\\n\\nFocus on Trees and Graphs. Make sure that you can explain your projects for at least 10 minutes and with respect to me HR round is just for formality in uipath and main focus is on coding rounds.

He gave me two questions one by one and told me to explain while solving. He gave me a link of a question from leetcode and told me to solve and run code on leetcode. Both questions are of medium - difficult level.\\n\\nQuestion 1: Find Duplicate Subtrees - LeetCode\\n\\nQuestion 2: Maximal Rectangle - LeetCode\\n\\nI solved both of them and all the test cases passed.

We started problem solving and he gave me a link of a question from leetcode. \\n\\nQuestion 1: Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum - LeetCode\\n\\nQuestion 2: Get the Maximum Score - LeetCode\\n\\nI solved both of them with all test cases passed. In the second question while I am thinking of logic he helped me to go in the correct path. After completing the code he told me to explain the code and asked some questions from the code. \\n\\n3rd Round (HR) :\\n\\nFirst interviewer introduced himself and told me to introduce myself. He asked about all my projects and told me to explain them. He asked some questions like Which tech stacks are used in this? What was the motivation to do this project? What difficulties did you face while making it and how you tackled it?”.\\n\\nAfter project discussion he asked some questions from object oriented programming like “tell me about virtual functions and how to implement it? What is the difference between overloading and overriding?”.\\n\\nAt the end I asked my doubts related to uipath and the interviewer answered and the session ended.\\n\\nTips for Interview of UIPath:\\n\\n\\n\\nFirst two rounds are coding rounds only so you need to practise as many questions as you can from leetcode or interviewbit. Focus more on Graphs, Trees and Dynamic Programming. You need to solve both questions in time.For HR round make sure that you can explain all your projects for 10-15 min at least and you should know the concepts of OOPS.\\n\\nAkshat Mittal : selected\\n\\nThere were 3 rounds of interview (2 technical + 1 HR). In each of the technical rounds, 2 \\n\\ncoding questions were asked. We had to write code in our own ide (screen was shared) \\n\\nand also run some test cases. The interviewers in all rounds were very friendly.\\n\\nRound 1 (PROBLEM SOLVING ROUND) :\\n\\nAfter the introduction phase, the interviewer jumped directly to coding questions.\\n\\nQ.1) Link- I gave the recursive approach and the interviewer was happy with it.\\n\\nQ.2) Link- I first gave O(n2) approach but then interviewer asked me to optimize it using\\n\\n\\tstacks. After some time, I got the approach.\\n\\nRound 2 (PROBLEM SOLVING ROUND) :\\n\\nQ.1) Link - Straight forward BFS question. I coded it and run the test cases.\\n\\nQ.2) Link- I first gave O(n) and O(1) solution (using arrays) for both functions\\n\\n\\t respectively but the interviewer told me to do in O(log n) for both. At last I was able to \\n\\n\\tgive the solution and the interviewer was very happy with the approach.\\n\\nNote: In coding rounds, even if you know the most optimized solution, do not start\\n\\ndirectly forming it.  Always give the brute force approach first and then optimize it \\n\\nGradually.  Interviewer may also ask you to optimize space instead of time, so listen \\n\\nCarefully and if you face any confusion, clarify it before solving.\\n\\nHR Round:\\n\\nAfter the intro phase, the interviewer asked me to brief about any one of my projects. Prepare around 7-8 minutes on this for each project since the interviewer may or may not give you a choice. Then he questioned me about why I preferred to use these tech-stacks over others and also asked me how I implemented the particular feature and what database I used.\\n\\nNext, he started asking me questions related to databases (noSQL). Also, if you used any kind of database in your project, he will try to relate questions of databases to that you used in your project.\\n\\nAt last, he asked me some easy OOPS questions and asked me if I wanted to ask something related. Do not say NO. Try to ask some questions like what kind of projects you will be working on.\\n\\nGeneral Tips:\\n\\n\\n\\nHR may ask questions related to operating systems; do not hesitate and just say that this course has not been covered yet in our curriculum.\\n\\nFor UI Path, CP is most important. Main focus was on Graphs and try to solve both questions within time.\\n\\nPrepare a good explanation for your projects.\"),\n",

It was a thorough process that checked both my technical skills and how well I fit with the company. \\n\\nFirst Round - Coding and OOPs:\\n\\nAt the beginning, I had a round where I had to solve coding problems and show my knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs). \\n\\nThe problems were not too hard, and I managed to solve them. One was about using maps, and the other was about trees.\\n\\nThe interviewer helped me make my solutions better, and even though I couldn't finish the tree problem completely, I explained how I would do it. In the first question I was asked to give an array of size n(size of input array) - k(continuous element that to be taken) in which we have to give the different element present in a continuous subarray of size k. For the second question I was asked to make changes at every node of a binary tree resulting in the node value as the sum of all of its cousins. \\n\\nSecond Round - Coding and CP:\\n\\nIn the next round, I had to solve more coding problems, this time with a focus on competitive programming (CP). I talked about my thought process and solved a map problem quickly.\\n\\nFor a tree problem, I gave a step-by-step plan instead of writing the full code because of the time restrictions. I also ran my code with different inputs to show that it worked. \\n\\nFinal Round - HR and Project:\\n\\nThe last round was about getting to know me better and talking about my projects. I talked about myself and one of my projects. They were interested in the libraries and functions I used. We discussed whether I like working alone or in a group. They also asked about my day and if I had any questions about the company. \\n\\nOverall, the interview covered a lot of things – coding skills, problem-solving, explaining ideas, and seeing if I'd be a good fit for the team. I'm excited about the chance to work at Zepto Zetta Solutions and learn even more during my internship!\")]"
